    "question": "What is a proxy, and how can I use one?",
    "answer": "A proxy server is a system or router that provides a gateway between users and the internet. Therefore, it helps prevent cyber attackers from entering a private network. It is a server, referred to as an “intermediary” because it goes between end-users and the web pages they visit online.\n When a computer connects to the internet, it uses an IP address. This is similar to your home’s street address, telling incoming data where to go and marking outgoing data with a return address for other devices to authenticate. A proxy server is essentially a computer on the internet that has an IP address of its own.\n How a Proxy Works\nBecause a proxy server has its own IP address, it acts as a go-between for a computer and the internet. Your computer knows this address, and when you send a request on the internet, it is routed to the proxy, which then gets the response from the web server and forwards the data from the page to your computer’s browser, like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge\n Benefits of a Proxy Server\n Enhanced security: Can act like a firewall between your systems and the internet. Without them, hackers have easy access to your IP address, which they can use to infiltrate your computer or network.\n Private browsing, watching, listening, and shopping: Use different proxies to help you avoid getting inundated with unwanted ads or the collection of IP-specific data.\n Access to location-specific content: You can designate a proxy server with an address associated with another country. You can, in effect, make it look like you are in that country and gain full access to all the content computers in that country are allowed to interact with.\n"

    "question": "Does ethical obligation go beyond standard ethical conduct?",
    "answer": "First of all, an obligation is another word for a contract. If you have a contract you must do it because you agreed to. Standard means whatever the majority has decided is the normal thing to do, and ethical conduct is an agreed upon set of rules everyone chooses to follow.\n Therefor, whatever is obligated goes WAY BEYOND whatever is standard. This means everything and not just ethics.\n Ethics are a set of agreed upon rules that everyone chooses to follow in order to keep the peace in any group (family, society, work, gathering, etc.). Sort of like going to a family reunion where no one gets along. Everyone agrees to be on their best behavior even though they would rather torment each other. Following some basic ethics (keep your bad thoughts to yourself, be polite, do not talk about stuff that starts fights, etc.) will allow all these people to have a good time, and keep those negative feelings from causing problems. When different social groups come together having an agreed upon set of ethics, that all choose to follow, will help reduce conflicts.\n"

    "question": "Why are scientists more concerned about the impact of CO2 in the atmosphere than water vapor?",
    "answer": "Why are scientists more concerned about the impact of CO2 in the atmosphere than water vapor?\n Water vapour might be the major contributor to the greenhouse effect, but the only way water vapour will increase and push temperatures up further is for there to be an initial increase in temperature. That initial increase has to come from something else such as an increase in CO2 or in solar activity. What we’ve seen since industrialisation and especially since the 1970s is a huge increase in our emissions. This is what is driving temperature change. Temperatures have risen a degree since the 1970s. And it’s not natural because solar activity is falling and the environment adds and takes out CO2 in roughly equal amounts; we only add it, thus the large increase. In fact, it’s increasing about 100 times faster than coming out of the last glacial period.\n Studies have found that for every degree increase in temperatures from our CO2 causes another degree increase due to the increase in water vapour (because warming means more evaporation, thus more water vapour in the air). Given it’s about a 1:1 relationship. An increase in CO2 comes first then temperature increase. For water vapour, it’s the other way round: temperature increases first, then water vapour. When you look at what’s actually causing temperatures to increase, water vapour drops out as per the diagram below. This is why scientists are more concerned about CO2 (and methane) than water vapour.\n"

    "question": "What is the difference between an entrepreneur and an entrepreneurial mindset?",
    "answer": "Before starting the entrepreneurship itself, you need to have an entrepreneurial mindset. The entity called 'The entrepreneurship' is actually the material manifestation of such a mind and it's attitude.\n People have a very rosy colored perspective of entrepreneurship. “Wow! Look at Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk or Richard Branson. Look, where they are.”\n Yes, they are at a fantastic place- Now!\n But when they started, they would not have had any entrepreneurship or even money to do it. They just would have had an idea. Whether to make it or throw it away, is their decision.\n It is their decision, whether to work 20 hours or just two hours on it/ day. Whether to invest more money into it or a lot of time into it. Whether to divide it as short term goals or work on the humongous project, one chip at a time.\n Whether to run around trying to make people see, what you see. Or to keep extremely quiet about it. Whether to always self- doubt or have faith in yourself and your project.\n The entrepreneurial mindset is very different from an employee mindset. An employee can go from 9–5pm, do the work with dedication, then come home, switch off work, relax and watch TV or listen to music. An entrepreneur is 'on the job' 24 hours/ 7 days/ 365 days- until you make something of it and later get some helping hand. Think about it.\n Let us take an example. Every one has a heart. It is beating, always. The second, it stops, the life of the person flies away. It is the same with the entrepreneurship. You, the entrepreneur- is the 'heart' of your entrepreneurship. The second you stop, the life of your project is done!\n Working as diligently as a human heart- no complaints, no strikes, no year-end reviews, no performance bonus, no applause, no recognition, No- nothing. But, you do the work- as a silent, efficient heart! Pushing the life blood all through the veins of your entrepreneurship, making every adjustment possible, along the way, if possible.\n Not everyone, is ready for that kind of commitment. It is deep, dedicated and diligent work- the mindset of an entrepreneur- that brings out a fantastic project to glowing recognition!\n Examples- so many. Whether it is Walt Disney, Andrew Carnegie, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg.\n The entrepreneurial mindset!\nImage credits-[LINKED_TEXT: Heart - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart]\n All the very best!

    "question": "If Republicans are supposedly fiscally responsible, why does the deficit increase every time they are in power?",
    "answer": "Because they are hypocrites. This whole fiscal responsibility mantra they chant goes back to Nixonian political strategy and goes like this: pillory the Democrats on the alter of the New Deal and blame these social programs they champion for the deficit while wearing the mantle of the fiscally responsible party; once in power, ignore the debt, drive up the deficit through tax cuts and deregulation and, after the debt goes up, blame the Democrats for the increase and champion further rugged individualism (austerity) for the poor and socialism for the rich. Watch as the Democrats pay down the debt, then rinse and repeat.\n Here’s a big truth-the debt doesn’t really matter; only growth does, which shrinks the debt in relative proportion, which makes the economy a denominator issue. Supply side economics attempts to stimulate growth through giving the rich more money and allowing it to trickle down into the economy all the while attempting to shrink spending. Which makes supply side economics a numerator problem that increases the impact of the debt on the economy.\n Any time a Republican talks piously about how fiscal responsible their party is, laugh in their face and vote for someone else.\n"

    "question": "What is the best ayurvedic medicine for diabetes?",
    "answer": "Diabetes is a serious and chronic condition that affects millions of people around the world. It is a metabolic disorder that occurs when the body is unable to produce or effectively use insulin, which leads to high blood sugar levels. While there are several conventional treatments available, many people turn to Ayurvedic medicine for a more holistic approach to managing their diabetes.\n Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India over 5,000 years ago. It is based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body, and spirit. Ayurvedic practitioners use a combination of herbal remedies, dietary changes, and lifestyle modifications to address the root cause of health problems and restore balance to the body.\n One of the most popular Ayurvedic medicines for diabetes is called “Maha Sudarshan Churna”. It is a combination of various herbs such as guduchi, ginger, cinnamon, and turmeric. These herbs are known to have antidiabetic properties and can help regulate blood sugar levels, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce inflammation in the body.\n Guduchi, also known as Tinospora cordifolia, is a powerful immune booster that has been shown to reduce blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Ginger, another common ingredient in Ayurvedic medicines, can help improve insulin sensitivity and lower fasting blood sugar levels. Cinnamon is known to enhance insulin sensitivity and improve glucose metabolism. Turmeric, which contains the active compound curcumin, has anti-inflammatory properties and can help protect against complications associated with diabetes.\n While Ayurvedic medicines can be beneficial for people with diabetes, it is important to note that they should always be taken under the supervision of a trained practitioner and should not replace conventional medical treatments. It is also essential to make lifestyle modifications such as eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, managing stress, and maintaining a healthy weight to effectively manage diabetes.\n In conclusion, Maha Sudarshan Churna is a popular Ayurvedic medicine for diabetes that contains a combination of herbs with antidiabetic properties. While Ayurvedic medicines can be helpful in managing diabetes, it is important to consult with a trained practitioner and follow conventional medical treatments to effectively manage the condition. Making lifestyle modifications such as healthy eating and regular exercise is also essential in managing diabetes and maintaining overall health and wellness.\n ALSO READ: [LINKED_TEXT: How Diabetes kills!] [URL: https://sites.google.com/view/healthyglucose/home]\n"

    "question": "What is the difference between lucid dreaming and astral projection?",
    "answer": "A lucid dream is a type of dream where the dreamer becomes aware that they are dreaming while the dream is still occurring. In other words, it is a dream in which you know that you are dreaming. This awareness allows the dreamer to have a certain level of control and volition within the dream environment.During a lucid dream, the dreamer may be able to consciously manipulate or direct the events, characters, and surroundings within the dream. They can choose to fly, explore different landscapes, interact with dream characters, and even alter the dream's storyline. Lucid dreaming can be a vivid and immersive experience, where the dreamer can actively engage and participate in the dream world.From a spiritual perspective, some people believe that lucid dreaming can offer a deeper understanding of oneself, provide opportunities for personal growth and exploration, and even serve as a gateway to spiritual realms. It is thought that lucid dreaming allows individuals to access higher levels of consciousness and tap into their inner wisdom.\nAstral projection (also known as astral travel) is a term used in esotericism to describe an intentional out-of-body experience (OBE) that assumes the existence of a subtle body called an \"astral body\" or \"body of light\" through which consciousness can function separately from the physical body and travel throughout the astral plane. The idea of astral travel is ancient and occurs in multiple cultures. The modern terminology of of \"astral projection\" was coined and promoted by 19th-century Theosophists .\n"

    "question": "Why does noise-cancelling headphones cause headache?",
    "answer": "Hi there!\n Great question! Some people do report experiencing headaches after using over-ear noise-canceling headphones, but it's important to note that these are not inherently headache-inducing for everyone.\n The cause of these headaches can vary between individuals and depend on several factors, including:\nPressure Sensation: Over-ear noise-canceling headphones, particularly those with active noise cancellation (ANC), work by creating a kind of 'sound vacuum' which can sometimes give a sensation of pressure, similar to being in a fast-elevating elevator or airplane. Some people may be more sensitive to this sensation, which can potentially lead to discomfort or headaches.Improper Fit: If your headphones are too tight or not correctly adjusted, they can put excessive pressure on your ears and the sides of your head, which can cause headaches after prolonged use. Always make sure your headphones fit comfortably!Prolonged Use: Using any headphones, not just over-ear noise-canceling headphones, for extended periods can lead to fatigue and strain, which might result in a headache. It's always a good idea to take regular breaks to rest your ears.Volume Levels: Listening to audio at high volumes can not only be damaging to your hearing but can also cause headaches. The beauty of over-ear noise-canceling headphones is that you can listen to your content at lower volumes, thanks to the reduced background noise.\nIf you're experiencing headaches after using over-ear noise-canceling headphones, it might be worth trying different brands or models, adjusting the fit, or taking more frequent breaks during use. If discomfort continues, you may want to consult a medical professional to ensure there isn't an underlying issue causing the headaches.\n Remember, everyone's experiences with headphones can be unique, and what might cause discomfort for one person might not for another.\n Hope this helps!

    "question": "How did a plane crash on the upper floors of the World Trade Center result in the entire building collapsing?",
    "answer": "In about 1985 the New York fire department got concerned about putting out fires in building like the twin towers that filled the skyline. They commissioned architects to model a skyscraper with a fire in the upper floors. No fire equipment was that tall and sprinkler systems couldn’t pump water that high fast enough to put the fire out so in 20 min the floors and furniture burn well enough to raise the temperature of the floor above to 2000f. The pre stress cables in the concrete floors expand and start to melt. When the upper floor falls it easily breaks the cables in the overheated floor below and no floor can support two falling floors much less all the floors above it. Their report made it clear that when a skyscraper gets a burning floor that you get all fire fighters out starting at 12 min. And spend all time getting people out of the building. At the time of the twin towers many years later not one of the recommendations from the report had been implemented. The plane crash behaved exactly as predicted in the report. 20 min after the crash the fire heated the ceiling floor to failure and we saw the wind push the walls outward as the stack of floors fall to the basement unimpeded by the floors below.\n"

    "question": "IF John Bonham never died in 1980, Led Zeppelin stayed together, The Beatles never broke up, and none of them died, do you think that the Music industry would be different today? Who do you think would be bigger?",
    "answer": "The Beatles didn’t just change music… they changed the world. If they’d stayed together, and none of the members had passed on, it’s impossible to say what music they might have created. It’s hard to imagine they could have kept up the pace of their creative output throughout the 60s. By the end of the decade, it seemed evident that they were all ready to strike out on their own. So, even if the band would have remained a unit, John, Paul, and George probably would still have pursued solo projects, which would likely have diluted the band’s output. And, as the studio laboratory demands an enormous amount of time and concentrated energy, it seems unlikely that they would have been able to return to that ultimate level of collaboration as a band.\n Led Zeppelin entered the scene just as The Beatles were beginning to burn out and fragment. They changed rock music forever by inventing an entirely new genre. Plant, Page, and Bonham have influenced nearly every rock singer, guitarist, and drummer that followed.\n A band like Zep is much better suited than The Beatles to stadium concerts and festivals, which were becoming more prevalent at the dawn of the 70s. As was the new freeform, DJ programmed FM Radio.\n Who knows which ensemble might have sustained more success or what the world might look like had they all kept the flame burning? Both bands were magical combinations of extraordinarily gifted, charismatic genius. It may seem obvious to say that the world is much better for the music of both bands. We’ll just have to be satisfied with the treasures they left us.\n"

    "question": "Why don't elite soldiers and Navy SEALs have physiques like Dwayne Johnson or Vin Diesel?",
    "answer": "Looking at this logically, the answer is usually pretty simple. Ever seen a huge musclebound man try to throw punches, run, or engage in sports that require flexibility? That huge, musclebound man is heavy, is slow, and is unable to move with any degree of flexibility. Even in the movies, you can see this in Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. But someone who is of average height, who takes care of themselves, is usually fast, flexible, and able to rely on their speed in addition to their weapons craft.\n Look at old portraits of warriors and warrior kings, whether as statues, reliefs, or paintings. Often you will notice that they were lean of frame, wiry, and often did not appear larger than others in the same paintings. And their leaner, wiry frames, meant that they did not need as much energy as someone who had huge muscles.\n Hence, why elite soldiers and Navy SEALs are generally not huge hulking mountains of muscle, but generally far leaner, with a much higher muscle force ratio. Size gets in the way of doing missions quickly.\n"

    "question": "What is the string theory about?",
    "answer": " String theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In string theory, one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force. Thus string theory is a theory of quantum gravity.\n String theory is a broad and varied subject that attempts to address a number of deep questions of fundamental physics. String theory has been applied to a variety of problems in black hole physics, early universe cosmology, nuclear physics, and condensed matter physics, and it has stimulated a number of major developments in pure mathematics. Because string theory potentially provides a unified description of gravity and particle physics, it is a candidate for a theory of everything, a self-contained mathematical model that describes all fundamental forces and forms of matter. Despite much work on these problems, it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world or how much freedom the theory allows to choose the details.\n"

    "question": "Why aren't there any tall buildings like the Empire State or Chrysler buildings anymore?",
    "answer": "While there are still many tall buildings being constructed around the world, there are a few reasons why there may be fewer iconic skyscrapers like the Empire State Building or the Chrysler Building being built today:\nCost: Building a tall skyscraper is an expensive undertaking, and the costs associated with designing and constructing a tall building continue to rise. The iconic skyscrapers of the past were often built during a time when building materials and labor costs were cheaper, and there was less regulation and bureaucracy involved in the building process.Location: Many of the world's tallest buildings today are being built in Asia and the Middle East, where land is less expensive and there is a greater demand for office and residential space. In contrast, in cities like New York, land is more expensive and there may be fewer opportunities to build tall buildings.Design and technology: While it is still possible to build very tall buildings, architects and builders are increasingly focused on creating structures that are environmentally sustainable, energy-efficient, and resilient to natural disasters. This may mean that the designs and technologies used in modern tall buildings are different from those used in the past, and may not necessarily result in the same type of iconic skyscrapers.Zoning and regulation: Many cities have zoning regulations and building codes that limit the height of buildings in certain areas, in order to protect historic buildings, preserve open space, or reduce congestion. This can make it more difficult to build tall buildings in certain locations.\n"

    "answer": "Here’s some of the key factors that contribute to successful sports betting:\nDoing your research: Knowledge is power in sports betting, so it's important to stay informed about the teams, players, and trends in the sport you're betting on. This includes understanding the statistics, injuries, and other factors that may impact the outcome of a game.Setting a budget: It's important to set a budget for your betting and stick to it. This means determining how much you can afford to lose and not exceeding that amount. It's also important to avoid chasing your losses, as this can lead to impulsive and irrational betting decisions.Avoiding emotional betting: It's common for sports fans to bet on their favorite teams or players, but this can lead to emotional betting decisions that are not based on logic or analysis. It's important to make bets based on objective analysis rather than personal biases.Being disciplined with your bets: Successful sports bettors are disciplined in their approach to betting, making calculated decisions based on research and analysis rather than impulse or emotion. This means avoiding impulsive bets and sticking to a consistent strategy over time.Realistic expectations: It's important to have realistic expectations when it comes to sports betting. While it's possible to make money from betting on sports, it's important to understand that there will be both wins and losses. Successful sports bettors are able to manage their expectations and maintain a long-term perspective.Shop for the best odds: Different sportsbooks may offer different odds for the same game or event. By shopping around and finding the best odds, you can increase your potential payout and reduce your risk.Focus on value: Successful sports bettors focus on finding value in their bets. This means identifying situations where the odds offered by the sportsbook are higher than the probability of the outcome occurring. By finding value bets, you can increase your long-term profitability.Manage your bankroll: It's important to manage your bankroll effectively to avoid losing all your money on a few bad bets. This means limiting the percentage of your bankroll you bet on any single game or event, and avoiding chasing losses by betting more than you can afford.Specialize in a particular sport: Many successful sports bettors specialize in a particular sport or league, as this allows them to develop a deep understanding of the teams, players, and trends that impact the outcome of games. By specializing in a particular sport, you can increase your knowledge and expertise, and make more informed betting decisions.Keep records: It's important to keep accurate records of your bets, including the amount wagered, the odds, and the outcome. This allows you to track your performance over time, identify areas for improvement, and adjust your strategy as needed.\n"

    "question": "Who was Mumtaz Mahal, and what was her relationship with Shah Jahan?",
    "answer": "Mumtaz Mahal was the chief wife of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. She was born in 1593 in Agra, India and was named Arjumand Banu Begum. She was the daughter of Asaf Khan, a prominent noble in the Mughal court.\n Shah Jahan fell in love with Arjumand Banu Begum when he was 14 years old and she was 15. However, they were not married until 19 years later, in 1612. After their marriage, she became known as Mumtaz Mahal, which means \"the chosen one of the palace\" in Persian.\n Mumtaz Mahal was an influential and powerful figure in the Mughal court. She was known for her beauty, intelligence, and her ability to influence her husband's decisions. She accompanied Shah Jahan on his military campaigns and was his trusted advisor.\n Tragically, Mumtaz Mahal died while giving birth to her 14th child in 1631. She was buried in a tomb in Agra, which later became known as the Taj Mahal. Shah Jahan was devastated by her death and decided to build the Taj Mahal as a mausoleum for his beloved wife. The Taj Mahal is considered one of the greatest examples of Mughal architecture and is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n"

    "question": "Which is the best car brand in the world?",
    "answer": "Oldsmobile F-88 Throughout the ’50s, General Motors hosted auto shows that displayed fancy prototypes and concept cars. But once out of the spotlight, the vehicles were supposed to be destroyed. The Oldsmobile F-88, designed in 1952 and 1953, was one of those dream cars that wasn’t destroyed and is today considered one of the greatest expressions of automotive design to ever come from North America. Only two were manufactured, with one of those now on display at the Gateway Auto Museum. Purchased for $3.24 million, the two-seat roadster with a fiberglass body is the collection’s crown jewel and possibly the world’s rarest automobile.  BMC Mini Proof that necessity is the mother of invention, the Mini was created by the British Motor Company in a period of drastic gas rationing in Great Britain in the late ’50s and early ’60s. Despite being just 10 feet long to achieve better gas mileage, the earliest Mini comfortably sat four people thanks to an engine that was mounted transversely, instead of front to back, allowing for more interior room. Since then, the Mini has been the inspiration behind later generations of small and smart cars.  Ford Mustang In the first six months of production in 1964, the Mustang was the fastest-selling car in history. It has since become an icon of style and performance among American automobiles, escorting in the “pony car” class of affordable sporty coupes with long hoods and short rear decks. Competitors raced to release their own versions, such as the Chevy Camaro, the Pontiac Firebird, and the Dodge Challenger. In 1964 alone, the Mustang was the pace car for the Indianapolis 500 and won both first and second in class at the Tour de France international rally. The museum is home to a 1967 Mustang Shelby GT 500 Fastback, designed by the legendary car constructor and race car driver Carroll Shelby.\n"

    "question": "Does evaporation increase viscosity?",
    "answer": "No.\n Of itself it has no effect. A pure substance will have its density, viscosity, refractive index, conductivity, specific heat and other physical quantities unchanged.\n However change in concentration of a solution or mixture resulting from evaporation will typically affect such properties. Whether the viscosity increases or decreases will depend on the mixture.\n For example benzene is more volatile than toluene. Thus a mixture of this will evaporate by releasing more benzene than toluene. Thus the concentration of toluene will increase in the remaining liquid.\n However toluene has a lower viscosity than benzene, thus the viscosity of the liquid will go down.\n On the other hand ethyl benzene has a higher viscosity than benzene, but a lower volatility. Thus as the mixture evaporates the concentration of the higher viscosity material increases and the viscosity goes up.\n For solid dissolved in liquid, increasing concentration of the solid generally results in an increase in viscosity. Thus if sodium chloride in water is subject to evaporation, the viscosity of the remaining brine increases.\n"

    "question": "How can white noise contain the least information, and highly losslessly-compressed data contain the most, while externally appearing the same signal type?",
    "answer": "This brings us to the point: what is “information“? Technically it’s never information that is measured but rather entropy. Colloquially, entropy is often identified with information. Also, the theory behind it is called “information theory” so the confusion is really pre-programmed. While entropy has a clear definition, information is never defined. At best, it can be said that information is the concept of encoding objects or events into strings of symbols taken from an alphabet. But there is no such thing as “information content”. Whether you encode something into a short or long string, really depends on your encoding, not on some dubious “information content”.\n That being said, we can still make sense of the observation that White Noise has a maximum amount of entropy. The clue is the concept of compression. The encoding of objects of low entropy can be compressed, while that of maximum entropy cannot. Why is that? Well, there’s a gazillion of possible images showing White Noise, while only a tiny fraction of images can really be identified as displaying, say, an animal. This is meant by saying that white noise has a high entropy (many possible events), while pictures of animals have a rather low entropy (few possible events). So, altogether, you need longer strings to encode all those white noise images, while you can use much shorter strings to encode images depicting an animal. It’s as simple as that. No mysterious “information content”.\n Note that you can, if you wish, use a very short string to encode a specific white noise image (if, of course, you replace the previous encoding for that string by some other, necessarily longer, encoding.) Nothing prevents you from doing that. But that doesn’t mean that this image suddenly gets a low entropy. Entropy is actually a property of an ensemble of objects or events, not of individual objects or events.\n So, to answer the original question, compression means reducing the redundancy. If (an ensemble of) objects have a low entropy then you can assign them to shorter strings than (ensembles of) objects having a higher entropy. For white noise there is no such redundancy. All pixel values are evenly distributed, there are no patterns. Patterns would mean you could devise an encoding that results in shorter strings. For white noise, there is no efficient encoding. A white noise picture has to be encoded as is, it can no further be compressed.\n"

    "question": "Heard lot of gurus say go deep or go inside. Where should I go? What is go inside?",
    "answer": "When you are aware of your body (the natural and automatic rise and fall of the breath, the posture of the body, the movements of the body), you are inside. When you are inside, it is much easier to watch your thoughts and emotions without forming any kind of attachment.\n Anchor your awareness in the breath. If that gets a little tricky, just feel your body from within. Some texts compare it to putting one’s awareness to the skeleton. Going deep happens automatically the longer you stay in.\n “Being inside” means residing in the body as the observer of what’s going on within that inner space—thoughts, emotions, physical sensations, other sensory experiences—without projecting the mind out (which is what happens when we follow a thought or act out an emotion). When the mind is projected out, consciousness gets entangled with the thousands or millions of concepts, ideas, judgments, beliefs, bodies, egos, and forms and then gets “lost” in the world—no longer knows itself. When the mind is kept in, consciousness remains itself. One is deeply-rooted.\n"

    "question": "Is reservation keeping casteism alive in India?",
    "answer": "Not necessarily, but it is much more complex than a simple yes or no. Reservation and casteism are two different issues but the cause-effect relationship often drags the other when one comes for discussion. They certainly require much detailed analysis than gross generalisation without any contempt for the other point of view. Any meaningful discussion is often plagued with abject ignorance of social realities outside the bubbles of one section and immediate ridicule of 'savarna ignornace’ of their counterparts who in turn are blinkered to the present status quo.\n It is unfortunate that any discussion on reservations riles up lot of emotions in our country. The reservations might have created, though indirectly, a vicious cycle of hatred but it only added another dimension to the already existing casteism. So it is safe to conclude that reservation isn't the one that's keeping the casteism alive but the age old concept of purity and superiority complex that emanates from it is. But the argument need to be further extended from here and not conluded, especially the “vicious cycle of hate\" needs to be further looked at.\n When the reservations were introduced in the constitution the assumption was that the increased literacy rate and political respresentaion for the oppressed would one day undo the need for them. But that assumption failed when the socialist economic policies and the increased nationalisation of every sector cornered the educated citizens of this country to prostrate before the government for any kind of employment. This was where the problem arose as it made the life of the the upper castes who were first to take the opportunities in greater number owing to their privelege stare at the glaring difference and lead to revival of casteism within the eduacted urban circles of the country. Thus creating vicious cycle of reservations leading to casteism leading to a further need for reservations. The most unfortunate outcome of all is that it is obstructing any meaningful debate on the required reforms. Blind hatred for Babasaheb Ambedkar out of pure ignorance and the equally sycophant following which apparently he suggested against is polarising the whole issue. The most deplorable is how the ‘new woke’ is interpreting the reservations as a tool of vengeance for the caste system which is fuelling the polarisation.\n Unless we take the initiative towards a meaningful dialogue, we are struck in this vicious cycle giving way to the forces who would happily cash the divide. Though debatable another sacrifice we made was a merit based system and a higher growth for equity. So we need to come up with other solutions to balance both merit and equity. One such accidental solution was opening the economy and economic boom that came along, today even the SC&ST's are ready to leave their benefits for certain jobs in the private industry. But we need more such solutions for which we need to be ready for the dialogue.\n"

    "question": "An encryption key in cryptography. What it is and how it's used in relation to something like AES?",
    "answer": "Strictly speaking, an encryption key is one of two inputs to an encryption function. The encryption function takes two inputs: the encryption key and the plain text, and outputs cyphertext (encoded text). The encryption function mathematically combines the plain text and the encryption key to produce the cyphertext.\n For a cryptosystem to be useful, there must also be a decryption function. This function takes as inputs the decryption key and the cyphertext, and outputs the original plain text. Like the encryption function, the decryption function mathematically combines the cyphertext and the decryption key to reconstruct the original plain text.\n In symmetric-key cryptography, the encryption key is also the decryption key. In symmetric-key cryptography, the encryption key must be kept secret to preserve the secrecy of the cyphertext. Examples of symmetric-key cryptography include AES, TwoFish, RC4, and 3DES.\n In asymmetric cryptography, the encryption key and the decryption key are different values. The most useful form of asymmetric cryptography is public-key cryptography where the keys are designated as the private key (which is kept secret) and the public key (which is not secret). Messages encrypted with one key can be decrypted by the other, which allows anyone to send secure messages to the holder of the private key, and allows the holder of the private key to prove their identity to anyone who has the public key. Public-key algorithms include Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, DSA, and RSA.\n"

    "question": "What are some little known benefits to leasing a vehicle rather than purchasing?",
    "answer": "Car leases often require an upfront fee, but they're typically less than what you'd pay for a car loan down payment. If cash is tight for you, leasing could help you afford a car sooner. If it's important to you to drive newer cars, a lease can make this more affordable than buying.\n Since leases usually only last two to four years, you can constantly upgrade to new cars with the latest safety and technology features. You can try out different cars more frequently, and since the vehicles are newer and you only have them for a few years, they may be less prone to mechanical issues.\n If you own a car and no longer want or need it, you have to sell it or trade it in, which can be quite a pain. When you lease, upon the end date, you simply return the vehicle. With newer leased cars, the warranty may cover any issues you run into. And in some leases, the lessor will pay for servicing or car problems not covered by the warranty.\n This isn't always the case, but if your lease covers these costs, you can avoid paying for car issues though you'll likely have to pay for routine maintenance such as oil changes and new tires. Leasing a car comes with plenty of expenses, from the upfront fee to the monthly payment, and sometimes, additional fees when the lease ends.\n You're in charge of paying for gas, possibly some repairs and car insurance, which can cost more for leased cars. You also typically owe a sizable fee if you terminate the lease early. While the ability to change [LINKED_TEXT: car accessories] [URL: https://delilreddot.com/] frequently can be a benefit to some, for other drivers it could be seen as a major hassle to have to go through the process of switching cars every couple of years.\n"

    "question": "Why do pitchers get new balls when the balls hit the ground, but when a ball is hit, it is thrown back to the pitcher and put back in play?",
    "answer": "Because on August 16, 1920, [LINKED_TEXT: Carl Mays] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Mays] killed [LINKED_TEXT: Ray Chapman] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Chapman] with a beanball when he crowded the plate, a ball that some observers say Chapman never saw coming. Prior to that, pitchers would load the ball up with tobacco juice and dirt specifically to reduce its visibility (especially of seam movement). A rule was quickly passed to require that umpires replace any ball that got dirty in order to keep balls as visible as possible.\n In the early days of professional baseball, one ball was used per game, period. If a ball stuck on the roof or was hit over the fence, play stopped until it was retrieved. In the rain, balls that got hit a lot lost their shape, could weigh double and even have seams burst. Still, the game played on with that ball.\n Given the aerodynamics of a baseball, any smoother or rougher spot, scuff or cut or protruding seam can be exploited by pitchers (air pressure pushes the ball away from smooth and toward rough). The powers that be do not like pitchers dominating. A pitcher’s duel is for the cognoscenti. Ordinary fans want to see offense.\n And so it was that in times of pitcher dominance, their advantages get taken away. The mound was reduced from fifteen inches to ten, for instance, during the era of Bob Gibson’s exploding fastball. And rules were not only strengthened against pitchers purposely affecting the ball, balls were increasingly examined for surface defects that came about in the ordinary course of play. When you see a pitcher feel up a ball in his hands and then reject it back to the umpire, that’s typically not because there’s something wrong with the ball but precisely because there’s nothing wrong with it.\n [LINKED_TEXT: A death at home plate] [URL: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/a-death-at-home-plate-84826570/]\n [LINKED_TEXT: The physics of baseball's most popular illegal pitches.] [URL: http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2006/10/how_to_throw_the_goopball.html]\n"

You send the money to his “agent” or a “shipping company”. The “box” gets “lost” so you need to send money again. This time there is an added cost for”insurance”. Still no box. Maybe he’s adding in the “Nigerian prince” scam, where he tells you the “box” is full of money that he needs to get out of Afghanistan. He and his partners are going to split the money and each of them have put up a security fee so if you want a share you need to do so too. So you put up the $5,000 and guess what?

There is the [LINKED_TEXT: Burckle Crater] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burckle_Crater] on the bed of the Indian Ocean, and it may be the remains of an asteroid hit followed by an iminami - a “megatsunami”.\n An asteroid going to hit world is likely to be noticeable for some time, so people are prone to interprete as “divine wrath” and take precautions (like Noah’s Ark). When it strikes, it first evaporates millions of a lot of liquid, which comes down as rain. It's going to then be followed by a humongous trend - possibly four kilometres large - enough to protect mountains when it strikes. The Biblical flooding misconception is a surprisingly precise information of such asteroid hit, the ensuing evaporation of liquid, rainfall together with iminami and rise of water.\n Such flooding may also cause mass fatalities of most residing things - also including seafood and other water life, once the heat and water chemistry will change. Just actually seaworthy boats and ships will endure these types of catastrophe.\n So an all natural disaster is an infinitely more rational explanation on which happened than discount all of it as a myth - or claim it as divine wrath.\n"

    "question": "How do you feel about Columbus Day?",
    "answer": "Christopher Columbus is typically represented as being the first European to set sail for the Americas. On occasion, he has received credit for finding the New World. But there are various points where this is in dispute. There is evidence that the first Europeans to cross the Atlantic were Scandinavian Viking explorers. Additionally, the Americas had already been \"discovered\" by indigenous peoples hundreds of years earlier.\n The first Columbus Day celebration was held in San Francisco in 1869 as a tribute to Italian-American heritage. The first state-wide occasion was held in Colorado in 1907. In the US, Columbus Day was proclaimed a national holiday in 1937. Since 1971, it has been celebrated on the second Monday in October. On the anniversary of Columbus' arrival in the Americas, some Latino communities in the United States and Latin America celebrate the Da de la Raza (Day of the Race). Nevertheless, it is a contentious celebration in certain countries and has seen name changes in others.\n Because a sizable portion of the native population died when European settlers arrived in the Americas, celebrations of Columbus Day are contentious. It has long been held that this was brought about by Columbus' actions. It is apparent that the arrival of European settlers led to the loss of a substantial portion of the history and culture of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Columbus only traveled as far as a few Caribbean islands and never made it to the interior of the continent, therefore some have argued that he shouldn't be credited with discovering North America.\n Read more, [LINKED_TEXT: Visit E and E] [URL: https://bit.ly/3BbPbCq]\n"

    "answer": "The question of why there seems to be a higher prevalence of depression among this generation is complex, and it is important to approach it with sensitivity and recognize that individual experiences can vary greatly. While it is not accurate to make sweeping generalizations about an entire generation, there are some factors that have been suggested as possible contributors:\nIncreased awareness and diagnosis: There is greater awareness and understanding of mental health issues today compared to the past. This awareness has led to more people seeking help and being diagnosed with depression.Stress and pressure: This generation faces unique challenges such as academic pressure, career uncertainty, financial burdens, and the impact of social media, which can contribute to stress and feelings of inadequacy or comparison.Social isolation: Despite increased connectivity through technology, social isolation and loneliness have become prevalent issues. Lack of social support and meaningful connections can contribute to feelings of depression.Economic factors: Economic instability and the difficulties in finding stable employment can lead to increased stress and a sense of hopelessness among young people.Environmental factors: Environmental issues, such as climate change and the resulting uncertainty about the future, can contribute to feelings of anxiety and depression.\nIt's important to remember that depression is a complex condition influenced by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors. While these factors may be relevant, it's crucial to approach the topic with empathy and consider the individual experiences and unique challenges faced by each person. If you or someone you know is experiencing depression, it's important to seek professional help from a mental health expert.\n"

    "question": "Is it bad for your vocal cords if you talk for hours every day?",
    "answer": "Yes. And No. It depends on how you’re using your voice.\n There are three crucial prerequisites you must employ in order to speak freely, with impact, conviction and ease, without hurting your voice.\n Ask yourself the following:\nIs your posture straight, and aligned top to bottom, like you would align the wood or metal to build a beautiful symmetrical instrument? Then you have a wonderful prerequisite to speaking for a long time without any damage.Is your motor working? Are you using your entire body, and especially the abdominals and intercostals to generate power in your power center around your tummy? This will allow your throat to be open. When your throat is open, nothing “grinds,” and your vocal folds are able to swing and vibrate easily without strain put upon them.Are you using your entire range of vocal vocabulary? If you’re overusing (most of us use only about 5–7 notes in our 25 note range) certain notes and their respective frequencies, your voice will show abuse there. Plus, your audience will get bored and start to tune you out. Use as much of your vocal range as your emotional range allows. This variety will keep your audience engaged and prevent strain and overuse of certain areas in your voice.\nOf course there’s the matter of energetics: Be the person you really are. Don’t pretend, don’t compensate. Be genuine, express yourself naturally, don’t try to emulate anyone else, and simply share from your heart, from your entire Being. Then the flow of your speaking will be guided from within, and can even heal your body.\n"

    "question": "What is the Poisson's ratio? What happens to a material if its Poisson’s ratio changes from negative to positive value?",
    "answer": "Poisson's ratio is a measure of the relationship between the change in lateral dimension of a material and the change in its axial dimension when subjected to an axial load. It is expressed as a fraction, where the numerator is the change in the lateral dimension and the denominator is the change in the axial dimension.\n Poisson's ratio can have a value between 0 and 0.5, with a value of 0 indicating that a material does not undergo lateral expansion, and a value of 0.5 indicating that the lateral expansion is equal to the axial compression. In some materials, Poisson's ratio is negative, meaning that the lateral expansion is in the opposite direction to the axial compression.\n If a material's Poisson's ratio changes from a negative to a positive value, it means that the material has undergone a change in its mechanical properties. This can be due to factors such as changes in temperature, stress, or composition.\n In general, a change in Poisson's ratio can have significant implications for the behavior of a material under load, as it affects its ability to deform and absorb energy. For example, a material with a low Poisson's ratio is generally stiffer and stronger, while a material with a high Poisson's ratio is more ductile and capable of absorbing more energy before failure.\n Understanding the behavior of a material in response to changes in its Poisson's ratio is an important aspect of materials science and engineering, and is essential for the design and optimization of many products and structures.\n"

And they are fascinating insects for the reasons already mention here and make interesting short lived easy to feed pets. But they are not much good for biological control of pests because 1.they are not numerous enough to do much good as mantises have only one brood (generation) a year while most pests have multiple broods a year. 2. Mantises are generalist predators meaning they prey on the beneficial insects such as pollinators bees, syrphid fly’s butterflies and others as well as pest species. And they will also prey on beneficial parasitoids of garden and crop pests such as tachinid flies and braconid wasps. and also aphid predators such as ladybird beetles and Lacewing bugs.And they will prey on other predators such as dragon flies ,ground beetles and spiders. All these predators and parasitoids are more effective in controlling pests in the environment and ecosystem because like the the pests they have several generations a year and are more host specific to the pests they attack unlike the generalist one brood a year praying mantis which eats just as many good bugs as bad bugs whatever it can catch and eat.

    "question": "Can we defeat Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle by having one person measure the particle's position, while another one measures its momentum, but the two people don't talk to each other, but give their results to a third party?",
    "answer": "No. Because one cannot take a sample out of the state of particle to conduct some measurement and not disturbe the system.\n To understand this let's take two situations unrelated to the question.\nSuppose you have a 1000 ml solution of sulphuric acid in water. Now your lab instructor asks you to find the concentration but the concentration of original solution must not change. Can you do it? Of course. You will take 10 ml of the solution as a sample conduct titration to know concentration. The original solution will remain undisturbed. Now your instructor tells you that actually there was unknown amount of sodium sulphate present in the original solution now find the amount of salt. No problem take another sample perform appropriate tests and you will know that. This kind of “sampling” is not possible in quantum mechanical systems. Now if you would have conducted titration on original solution you could not have predicted amount of salt with full certainty. This is known as collapse of wave function. Before measurement particle might not be at a fixed position but after measurement it will collapse to the position measured by you. As the state is no longer the original state there might be uncertainty in measurement of other observables like momentum energy etc.Let's say you have a electrical circuit. There is a certain voltage across a resistor. If you have to measure it you must connect a voltmeter across resistor but a s soon as you connect a voltmeter the voltage across the resistor changes. Now if you connect a ammeter to measure current the current measured will no longer be the actual current.\nThe two examples given are just analogies to understand uncertainty. Complete description of laws of quantum mechanics cannot be explained by theses analogies.\n"

Realize that you are there to help to build your employers dreams, find out what they are and if possible make them yours. If you can't then move on\n 4. Find mentors, both inside and outside the company. \n 5. Learn everything you can about the business, become an expert. Begin on your own time, but if you are asked to attend a conference, do not waste the opportunity.  Learn everything you can, find out who is who, learn about your competition - ask yourself what you can do to improve your own company.\n 6. Treat your company as if it were your own (better still, if you have the chance buy shares or options, then it will be, at least in part).\n 7. Never treat your place of employment merely as somewhere to show up for 8 hours a day. \n 8. Do not expect notice or reward.  Make sure your manager knows and approves of what you are doing, make suggestions or simply lead by example.\n 9. Do not stick with a toxic manager.  Some people are simply obnoxious, you can't change them.  If you like the company, look for sideways transfers and promotions that will take you out of their sphere of influence.  If you can't, don't waste your time, move on. \n 10. Keep your sense of humour. Being a diplomat does not mean being a doormat.  \n These will not give you an immediate higher salary, but they will open doors for promotion and pay raises that won't be offered to everyone. \n"

    "question": "Why are conservatives outraged when citizens get student loan relief, but are all for giant corporations being bailed out when they cannot repay their loans?",
    "answer": "Bailing out students loans is a good idea, but the Devil is in the details.\n Scholarships have been around since, like, forever.\n So, no big deal in funding more students.\n And, the thing is, most forgiving rules are about federal loans and there are many conditions to be eligible, like earning less $125k, and have already made 120 payments, and so on..\n It does not really look like free money given away randomly.\n Maybe people who criticise loan forgiveness think the government wants to start spending outrageously on worthless education that will produce unusable educated fools?\n If it were the case, that would probably be a valid objection, but it is not.\n If some individuals object to the federal state bearing the burden of funding the risk to higher education, a good tradeoff is what they are doing, forgiving student loans for individuals who have successfully completed their training and found a related job, demonstrating the spending was useful.\n In that case, they could probably even do more, at least for US citizens, improving long term education levels without causing unbounded public expenditures.\n Cherry on top, if students knew their loan would be forgiven with relevant choices and success, they would be even more motivated in their studies.\n"

    "question": "Why should we plant more trees if forests are fuel for wildfires and could end up adding more CO2 to the atmosphere than say, the deserts?",
    "answer": "Only some ecosystems have natural wildfire regimes. It wouldn’t make much sense to plant more trees in some parts of the American West since it is constantly on fire right now. It DOES make sense to plant trees in other places where wildfires aren’t a major concern and forests used to exist.\n The area that is now the United States of America was 50% forest in 1630. In 2010, it was 29% and we’ve lost more of our old growth forests than most other countries. Much of that forest cover was replaced with cropland or artificial pastures for livestock. Some forests were even turned into barren wastelands by industrial pollution and still haven’t recovered.\n Planting trees to help reclaim polluted environments and abandoned farms is much better than turning them into a desert or something. Yes, those trees will die, but a portion of their carbon will be stored underground indefinitely. It isn’t nearly as effective as just using fewer fossil fuels, but it doesn’t hurt either. If nothing else, it helps combat habitat loss.\n"

Up to about 20 items are served thereafter by ‘WAZA’ (the junior cook). Seven dishes are a must for these occasions — Tabakh Maaz, ‘RISTA’ (meatballs in a red, paprika-saffron-fennel spice gravy colored with dyer’s alkanet), ‘ROGAN JOSH’, ‘DANIWAL KORMA’ (lamb roasted with yoghurt, spices and onion puree, topped with coriander leaves), ‘AAB GOSH’ (lamb chunks cooked with a fennel-based spice mixture, cardamom and partially evaporated milk), ‘MARCHHWANGAN KORMA’ (chicken legs/thighs cooked in a spicy browned-onion sauce) and ‘GUSHTABA’ (meatballs cooked in a spicy yoghurt gravy).The main course usually ends with GUSHTABA. The Gushtaba is a large meatball which signals the end of the main course. After that, desserts are served. In winters, the dessert can be a hot sweet dish and in summers, it is usually something cold.\nHISTORY OF WAZWAN\n The delicious food of J&K is believed to have evolved when the Timurs invaded Kashmir in the 15th century A.D. and thousands of expert cooks from Samarkand immigrated to cater to the Indian Kings. Those master cooks were called ‘WAZAS’ and they worked under the guidance of ‘VASTA WAZA’, the master chef. They offered the kings a grand feast, which is traditionally known as ‘WAZWAN’ and is still in practice. The special grand feast is characterized by 36 different kinds of meals, out of which fifteen to thirty dishes are the varieties of meat. Today, Wazwan is not only a ritual but also a ceremony. During a trip to J&K, you can enjoy this luxurious food style. Kashmiri weddings are popular for the delicacies mastered by those chefs.

Thus, the “approximate” settings of the thermostatic control are even more erratic considering the mill scale, rust, dirt, foreign material and other stuff getting between the sensing contact plate and the outer tank wall, not to mention the cheap junk mounting system. All of these things combined are going to cause great variations in the actual water temperature not only over time, but often from cycle to cycle because things keep moving with each heating and cooling cycle.\n The only way to really know what your water temperature is, is to take a measurement right at the unit itself and monitor those measurements over a week of use to see how much variation there is and whether or not the temperature is dropping below the minimum 160°F that is required to properly disinfect pipes. Speaking of which, those mixing valves which are now mandated by the same controlling authoritarian Government buffoons who create problems while needlessly driving up costs create sections of piping and appliances which never get disinfected and cause the spread of killers like Legionella regardless of what temperature the water heating appliance is set to. - MarkKw\n"

    "question": "How does a wave function collapse in quantum mechanics/physics?",
    "answer": "A wave function collapses upon observation of a quantum system. In fact it’s true for all systems, but it’s simply too difficult to detect when masses are large enough.\n Before measurement of the system, it could be in a superposition of many different states, meaning that the electron (or whatever) could be in more states than “up” and “down”. It could be “three quarters down, one quarter up” or “half down, half up” or any other such combination of states. This leads to bizarre results such as a single electron being in several places at once, if we don’t measure it.\n But when we do measure it, this goes away and the electron demonstrates only a single state, as we would expect from a classical system.\n As for what happens to the other possibilities, that is entirely unknown. Some believe that alternate universes are created so that every possible measurement of the system is realized (the Many Worlds or Everettian Interpretation); the so-called Copenhagen Interpretation says that the physical laws of quantum physics only give probabilities and that it’s foolish to hope for them to give a definite answer.\n And there are plenty more interpretations of this collapse. Embarrassingly, no one has the faintest idea which interpretation is correct, and the question was largely ignored by physicists in the past. If physicists said that they knew about the problem and elected to focus on other things - okay, fine. But historically, they instead said that there was no problem and that it always had a solution, which is still not true.\n"

    "question": "Can you ever take out a loan with bad credit?",
    "answer": "Loan in Texas will vary from one financial services provider to another. Applications can be filled out online or in-person at a bank or credit union, and a borrower will have to provide their full name, income, employment information, home address, credit score, payment history, contact information, desired loan amount, and their reason for the loan.\n Before you receive the personal loan, make sure to review its terms and conditions, interest rate, and repayment plan. This may seem tedious, but reading the fine print can help you avoid unexpected charges or hidden fees.\n Once you’ve finalized the personal loan documents and agreed to the loan terms, you’ll likely receive your funds within a week. Be sure to make all payments on time to avoid additional charges and consider putting more money toward each monthly payment if you can.\n Email your personal loan application to [LINKED_TEXT: ecoloans628@gmail.com] [URL: mailto:ecoloans628@gmail.com] Telephone:+1 318 377 1954\n The money will be loan to you.

    "question": "Why does it appear Captain America's Vibranium shield seems almost indestructible, but in ‘Black Panther’ the Vibranium armored cars are easily destroyed? Are there different types of Vibranium?",
    "answer": "There are different types of Vibranium but lets answer the first question. Captain America’s shield is not made of just vibranium. As early as the 1930s the U.S. was developing almost indestructible metal alloys which were named after the mythical metal that Dante mentioned in the Inferno adamantine.\n A small sample vibranium was obtained by U.S. intelligence. Vibranium in original comics was a meteoric metal that absorbed vibrations.\n Accidently the vibranium piece was melted and mixed with one of the experimental adamantine compounds in a mold that gave the shield its aerodynamic properties. It is closer to unbreakable and harder then any currently available metal while the vibranium makes it absorb vibrations which helps give it its bouncing power and resistance to sonic weapons.\n The vibranium that absorbs vibrations like sound is only found in Wakanda. A second type called polar vibranium is found in the Savage Land and gives off vibration. Small amounts can shatter stone and metal.\n The vibranium armor on the cars lacked the unbreakability of the alloy the shield is made of.\n"

    "question": "How do you stop relying on consultants by building your company’s innovation capabilities?",
    "answer": "Simple Answer, re: Q: Stop Relying on Consultants?\n Make Vs. Buy! Do you want to Make / Fund / Create the Innovation Competence “In-House”? Or do you want to Buy it from Outside when you Need it?\n Human Capital Question? Do you Staff for the Valleys? Or… Do you Staff for the Peaks?\n If Investment Capital is plentiful, then it’s easy to spend the money and hire all the Competence you need for In-House. However, if Investment Capital is scarce, then, rather, you go find it and buy it when you need it.\n Make Vs. Buy! Staff for the Valley or the Peak! Thinking of it in those terms make it a pretty simple question.\n Anecdotally, some of the World’s largest companies over the last generation have shifted from In-House “Blue Skies” Research to “out-sourcing R&D,” that is, to let Risk Capital fund “Blue Skies” R&D outside, then pick and choose from among the winners. That’s been a big Pharma model for years. And big companies like DuPont moved to it a generation ago.\n They still keep some R&D capacity in-house, e.g., IEP R&D, IEP=Improvement of Existing Products. That is, they don’t walk away entirely.\n R&D Capital — what the Questioner calls “Innovation Capabilities” — always is Risk Capital, often highly speculative, and today it’s often “too big of a Risk” for even large companies to take. That’s why VC (Venture Capital) R&D Risk Capital is highly rewarded with attractive multiples because big companies are paying them to take the Risk.\n If the Questioner wants to build “Innovation Capabilities,” no problem, just $$$ Spend Away!\n"

    "answer": "Depends on how pedantic you want to be.\n While they’re not technically considered “pistols”, revolvers do not have slides.\n There are iterations of firearms that are legally classified as “pistols” despite having rifle action (E.G. Ar-15 pistol with a barrel/overall length of less than 16″/26″ respectively & no “buttstock), which do not have slides.\n While the technology is still in its infancy stages, there do exist gauss-pistols which, while not legally considered “firearms”, are still considered “pistols”, which do not utilize slides, or even gunpowder (Gauss weapons utilize magnetic coils surrounding the barrel to launch projectiles).\n Another footnote would be the Laugo Alien which, while it does have a slide, it takes strides in redefining how the slide works; the most visibly obvious trait being that the reciprocating slide sits underneath a fixed rail.\n There have also been several iterations of pistols that utilize bolts which, unlike the aforementioned AR-15 example, fit more closely to the traditional definition of “pistol”.\n"

    "question": "What are some astrological facts about Uranus?",
    "answer": "Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It's not obvious to the unaided eye, and turned into the principal planet found with the utilization of a telescope. Uranus is spilled on its side with a hub slant of 98 degrees. It is regularly portrayed as \"moving around the Sun on its side.\"\n Realities about Uranus\n Uranus was formally found by Sir William Herschel in 1781.\n It is too faint to even consider having been seen by the people of yore. From the outset Herschel thought it was a comet, yet quite a while later it was affirmed as a planet. Herscal attempted to have his revelation named \"Georgian Sidus\" subsequent to King George III. The name Uranus was recommended by stargazer Johann Bode. The name comes from the old Greek divinity Ouranos.\n Uranus turns on its pivot once like clockwork, 14 minutes.\n The planet pivots a retrograde way, inverse to the manner in which Earth and most different planets turn.\n Uranus makes one outing around the Sun each 84 Earth years.\n During certain pieces of its circle either of its shafts point straightforwardly at the Sun and get around 42 years of direct daylight. The remainder of the time they are in murkiness.\n Uranus is frequently alluded to as an \"ice goliath\" planet.\n Like different gas goliaths, it has a hydrogen upper layer, which has helium blended in. Underneath that is a cold mantle, which encompasses a stone and ice center. The upper climate is made of water, alkali and the methane ice gems that give the planet its light blue tone.\n Uranus hits the coldest temperatures of earth.\n With a base barometrical temperature of - 224°C Uranus is the coldest planet in the nearby planetary group. While Neptune doesn't get however cold as Uranus it seems to be on normal colder. The upper air of Uranus is covered by a methane cloudiness which conceals the tempests that occur in the cloud decks.\n Uranus has two arrangements of slim dull shaded rings.\n The ring particles are little, going from dust-sized particles to little stones. There are eleven inward rings and two external rings. They likely shaped when at least one of Uranus' moons were separated in an effect. The primary rings were found in 1977 with the two external rings being found in Hubble Space Telescope pictures somewhere in the range of 2003 and 2005.\n Uranus' moons are named after characters made by William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.\n These incorporate Oberon, Titania and Miranda. All are frozen universes with dull surfaces. Some are ice and rock combinations. The most intriguing Uranian moon is Miranda; it has ice gorge, patios, and other bizarre looking surface regions.\n Just a single rocket has flown by Uranus.\n In 1986, the Voyager 2 rocket cleared past the planet a ways off of 81,500 km. It restored the primary close-up pictures of the planet, its moons, and rings.\n"

    "question": "Why is #ISRO trending on Twitter?",
    "answer": "The perception that a particular generation is universally unhappy is a broad generalization that may not apply to everyone. Happiness and well-being are complex and multifaceted concepts influenced by various factors. However, there are several possible reasons why some individuals in a given generation may report feelings of unhappiness or dissatisfaction:\nIncreased Pressure and Expectations: Modern societies often place significant pressure on individuals to succeed academically, professionally, and socially. The pressure to meet high expectations and achieve certain milestones can lead to stress, anxiety, and a sense of dissatisfaction if personal goals are not met or if there is a constant fear of falling short.Technological Influence: The prevalence of technology and social media can have both positive and negative impacts on happiness. While technology offers numerous benefits, such as connectivity and access to information, it can also contribute to feelings of social comparison, isolation, and the fear of missing out (FOMO). Constant exposure to curated representations of others' lives on social media can create unrealistic expectations and a sense of inadequacy.Economic Challenges: Economic factors, such as high living costs, income inequality, and job instability, can significantly impact overall well-being. Financial stressors, lack of job security, and limited economic opportunities can contribute to feelings of unhappiness or dissatisfaction.Mental Health Concerns: The recognition and understanding of mental health issues have increased in recent years. This increased awareness has led to more individuals seeking help and speaking openly about their struggles. However, it has also highlighted the prevalence of mental health challenges in society. Factors such as stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions can contribute to feelings of unhappiness.Societal Issues and Concerns: Societal issues, such as climate change, political instability, social inequality, and global crises, can affect individuals' perceptions of the world and their own well-being. Heightened awareness of these issues and the challenges they present can lead to a sense of uncertainty, hopelessness, or frustration.\nIt's important to remember that happiness and unhappiness are subjective experiences, and not everyone in a generation will have the same feelings or experiences. Each person's well-being is influenced by a unique combination of personal circumstances, upbringing, mindset, and other individual factors. It's essential to approach discussions about happiness with nuance and consider the diverse range of experiences and perspectives within a generation.\n"

You do not have to submit biometrics again for any visa or permit applications during the biometrics validity period.\n Once you have submitted your biometrics then IRCC will begin to process your study permit application. It starts with an eligibility check. If your application passes the eligibility check IRCC will ask you to submit your medical exam and they will begin your background check. All of the documents and information in your study permit application will be verified during the background check. At the same time your completed medical exam will be sent to a CIC medical officer for review. Once those are complete you will receive a decision letter telling you if your application was approved or denied.\n The average processing time for a study permit application is 7 weeks.

    "question": "Is complete stillness the key for samathi, trance, the infinito, or can it be reached with a more active process, like recitation of some kind, chanting, dancing, etc.?",
    "answer": "The Buddha taught (samma-samadhi*) ‘right stillness’ and liberating insight. Samma-samadhi is one factor in the eightfold path.\n The Buddha didn't teach trance or, whatever the other thing is.\n Chanting or recitation of the Buddha’ teachings was an early form of transmission of the teachings as the Buddha lived in the ‘Iron Age' and writing systems weren't widespread.\n The chanting wasn't carried out to induce a state of trance.\n Those who practice the five Buddhist precepts may dance if they feel like it. Others, may practice a no-dancing precept.\n During a silent Buddhist retreat your unlikely to see a lot of dancing going on.\n*\n[LINKED_TEXT: The Jhanas (E-book) | Buddhist Society of Western Australiahttps://bswa.org/teaching/jhanas-e-book/] [URL: https://bswa.org/teaching/jhanas-e-book/][LINKED_TEXT: the simile of the cup ajahn brahm bswathe simile of the cup ajahn brahm bswa - Bing video Videoshttps://www.bing.com/videos/search?view=detail&mid=67F6A8EAD8122AE6A8B567F6A8EAD8122AE6A8B5&q=the simile of the cup ajahn brahm bswa&shtp=GetUrl&shid=8b250784-f6d5-4f7a-91a8-9db88ef881e4&shtk=QWphaG4gQnJhaG0gLSBTaW1pbGUgT2YgVGhlIEN1cA%3D%3D&shdk=QWphaG4gQnJhaG0gLSBTaW1pbGUgT2YgVGhlIEN1cA%3D%3D&shhk=pBjYjG5bmMOB7Yr8OKba9IsvbM4YScNQgMXRlfK18kA%3D&form=VDSHOT&shth=OVP.tBm4hV3KUpkNB3t0xf5llAEsDh] [URL: https://www.bing.com/videos/search?view=detail&mid=67F6A8EAD8122AE6A8B567F6A8EAD8122AE6A8B5&q=the%20simile%20of%20the%20cup%20ajahn%20brahm%20bswa&shtp=GetUrl&shid=8b250784-f6d5-4f7a-91a8-9db88ef881e4&shtk=QWphaG4gQnJhaG0gLSBTaW1pbGUgT2YgVGhlIEN1cA%3D%3D&shdk=QWphaG4gQnJhaG0gLSBTaW1pbGUgT2YgVGhlIEN1cA%3D%3D&shhk=pBjYjG5bmMOB7Yr8OKba9IsvbM4YScNQgMXRlfK18kA%3D&form=VDSHOT&shth=OVP.tBm4hV3KUpkNB3t0xf5llAEsDh]"

    "answer": "The call history of a mobile phone number can typically be found by checking the call log on the phone itself, as well as in the monthly statements or records provided by the mobile network operator or carrier. The exact methods and processes for accessing call history records can vary depending on the carrier and country in which the phone is registered.\n Typically, the call log on a mobile phone will contain a record of all incoming and outgoing calls, as well as any missed calls, and can be accessed by going to the phone's call history or call log menu. However, it is important to note that this information is only stored on the phone itself and may be deleted by the user at any time.\n In order to access call history records from a mobile network operator or carrier, you may need to contact their customer service department and provide information such as the phone number and account information. Depending on the policies of the carrier, there may be fees or restrictions on accessing call history records, and some carriers may only provide records for a limited time period.\n It is important to note that accessing someone else's call history without their permission or a valid legal reason could be considered a violation of privacy and may be illegal.

After guests check out, the hotel staff collects used soap bars and sends them to recycling facilities or organizations that specialize in redistributing them to those in need.\n These organizations typically sanitize and reshape the used soap bars to make them safe and usable again. The recycled soap can then be distributed to people in developing countries who do not have access to basic hygiene products. This can help to prevent the spread of diseases and improve overall health and well-being.\n Some hotels also partner with organizations that provide job training and employment opportunities for disadvantaged individuals by processing and distributing the recycled soap. This can have a positive social impact by helping to reduce unemployment and poverty.\n In addition to soap recycling programs, some hotels also offer eco-friendly amenities and practices, such as using biodegradable cleaning products, reducing energy consumption, and implementing waste reduction initiatives, in an effort to promote sustainability and responsible tourism.\n"

    "answer": "The Second Amendment is about political power — which, as Chairman Mao explained, grows out of the barrel of a gun. The American Revolution and, in Europe, the Battle of Valmy demonstrated a development in military strategy that occurred at that particular stage of technological history — the power of massed musketry, requiring little training and no more than average strength and skill. For about 100 years, a sizeable and “well regulated militia” was the apex of military might. Like all of the Bill of Rights, Amendment II was designed to curb the power of the new federal government. “The right of the people to keep and bear arms” actually meant the right of the state governments to maintain and control their own armed forces, though not necessarily — nor preferably, in the minds of the Anti-Federalists whom the X Amendments were designed to mollify — in the form of standing armies. Governmental limitations on the’ possession of firearms by individuals weren’t an issue because no one even thought of such a thing.\n"

Label them all, with 1 at the root, 2 and 3 on the next level, etc. That should give us the information we need.\n Look at the bottom row and imagine that there’s nothing after row 10. That would still be a complete binary tree. If we have node 10, then we need all the nodes up to 10. So all we have to do to know how many nodes are missing is to know what the highest node we have is and how many nodes we actually have.\n Walk the tree recursively, starting at the root, which we’ll say has index 1. Keep a highestNodeFound variable that starts at 0. For every node we examine, we do two things:\nset highestNodeFound = max(highestNodeFound, index)add 1 to nodeCount\nThen recurse, calling examineNode(leftSubtree, index * 2) and examineNode(rightSubtree, index * 2 + 1). Once you’re done, the difference between these two is the number of missing nodes.\n"

    "answer": "You don’t have a theory.\n You have a bunch of words thrown together in a fashion that is reminiscent of the “tech talk” gobbledygook one hears on sci-fi television series like Star Trek.\n To turn that word salad into a theory, learn the relevant physics. Learn how to model your idea using the equations of mathematical physics. Make predictions as to the intensity, spectral characteristics, temporal evolution and other properties of the burst according to your idea. Compare your predictions to actual observational data from gamma ray bursts, see if there is a reasonable correlation.\n If the predictions from your model are sound, and if they are not contradicted by observational data, then write it all up. The model, its mathematical representation, derivations of its predictions, sources of observational data, the statistical methods used to compare your model against that data, analysis of errors and uncertainties, the whole kaboodle. Once you wrote it all up, send it to a reputable journal (not a junk journal that publishes any piece of nonsense so long as the fees are paid). Do not be deterred by rejections; argue with referees, improve your paper, send it to another (reputable) journal if necessary. See to it that it is published.\n Meanwhile, do not stop working: Get more data, see if you can make further comparisons between model and reality, refine the model, strengthen its predictions. Publish more papers if applicable. See what other consequences your model offers that may be verifiable through observation.\n Once you have done all this work (yes, hard work) then you should feel free to announce to the world, proudly, that you have a theory.\n And no, nobody else is going to do it for you. If you do not have the inclination to learn the hard physics, fine; not everyone can be a basketball player or concert pianist either. But don’t expect anybody else do it for you. Crazy ideas are a dime a dozen, and people who have learned the math and physics have better things to do with their time and talent. If your crazy idea actually has merit, the burden of proof is on you: You need to learn the tools, the techniques, you need to find ways to assert the validity of your concepts.\n"

    "question": "Is the resource curse a myth?",
    "answer": "It is not completely a myth, by any means, especially for places whose government *assumes* that it must be in charge of society’s resources, in general. It *can* be resisted, but only at substantial political cost as long as the society in question has large portions of its people making the assumption that the government is there to do more than defend them from physical invasion. That “more” being the assumption the government is also there to also allocate resources to uplift them economically without them changing themselves.\n This can produce great strain on any government that refuses to rely on any single resource, mined, drilled, grown, or otherwise. When taxes *are* spread throughout the population, then *some* of those with less will want “leveling” efforts in favor of themselves, without them having to adapt to markets at all. This produces demands that, “since they didn’t *make* resource X”, then they shouldn’t benefit so much more from it”. (Never mind the costs of investing to extract “resource X”, or transporting it, or anything else, just because it came out of the ground).\n To the extent the government is strong enough in adhering to market principles, then they can resist the resource curse. Too few are, because it means telling those that work for them that they won’t be rewarded as much as they could be. Few populations are still willing to adapt to markets, and adapt again and again, in the knowledge that some markets have made others richer, without visible work. The government that resists the curse must push their population to adapt again and again and again, to markets. Otherwise, the 4% who assume they should be as rich as the next guy, without changing their behaviors, will win in the end.\n"

    "question": "Time doesn't exist for a photon, but do sequences of events exist in a photon?",
    "answer": "In QED, all “Feynman diagrams” contribute using “time ordered products”… which basically means, every possible “history” or qualitative story about the process that could contribute, does contribute. And the “events” in that story occur in all logically-possible time orderings.\n However, in that QED picture, any one photon does only 3 things: get emitted, propagate, and get absorbed. They do not experience any other events, so the “sequences” consist of only 3 events. And those 3 events can be regarded as happening in reverse order with reversed names — both contribute. So all 2 orderings happen.\n In a non-QED non-fundamental view of things, a photon could, e.g. pass thru a sequence of 57 prisms changing direction each time. (The QED view would be: it is no longer the same photon.) In that non-QED view, note the photon travels slower than lightspeed inside the glass (not a vacuum). Or photon could pass thru some sugar solutions, changing its polarization. Again: slower than lightspeed. So in this non-QED view, there no longer can be any claim in these situations that these photons “cannot experience time.” They do.\n"

    "question": "Why do some people like to stay in an abusive relationship?",
    "answer": "There are many reasons why people may stay in unhealthy or abusive relationships. Some of the most common reasons include:\nFear: Some people may stay in an unhealthy or abusive relationship because they are afraid of leaving, whether it's fear of being alone, fear of retaliation, or fear of not being able to financially support themselves.Low self-esteem: People with low self-esteem may believe that they don't deserve better treatment, or that they are not capable of being in a healthy relationship.Cultural or societal pressures: Some people may feel pressure from their culture or society to stay in a relationship, regardless of how unhealthy or abusive it is.Lack of support: Some people may not have access to support systems, such as friends, family, or professional help, that could help them leave an unhealthy or abusive relationship.Hope for change: Some people may stay in an unhealthy or abusive relationship because they believe that their partner will change, or that things will get better over time.Love and emotional attachment: People may stay in an unhealthy or abusive relationship because they love or are emotionally attached to their partner, and find it difficult to let go.Financial dependence: Some people may stay in an unhealthy or abusive relationship because they are financially dependent on their partner, and they fear they will not be able to support themselves if they leave.Children: People may stay in an unhealthy or abusive relationship because they want to keep their family together, and they fear that leaving will harm their children.\nIt's worth noting that, Leaving an unhealthy or abusive relationship can be difficult, but it's important to remember that no one deserves to be treated poorly, and that there are resources and support available to help people leave. It's also important to understand that it is not the victim's fault and they should not be made to feel guilty for staying in an unhealthy or abusive relationship.\n"

    "answer": "Absolutely!\n As already mentioned, Rolex advertised their Submariner model with a suit, and furthermore, Sean Connery was also seen wearing the Submariner with a suit in the James Bond movie.\n The Submariner has grown so immensely popular partly because it has proven to be so immensely universal. It is made to be a rugged diver’s watch, able to withstand extreme pressure, but at the same time, today, the majority of people who wear a Submariner never even shower with their watch, not to mention dive with it.\nThe Submariner really has a timeless design, and it has an impressive versality since it looks just as good with a diver’s suit as with jeans, or with a suit.\n In the Rolex advertisement for the Submariner, Rolex wrote “You’ll find it in the cockpits of most ocean racers as hard-driving skippers beat down to Bermuda, Hobart, and the Fastnet Rock. How come it’s seen so much where the wettest thing is a Dry Martin? Who knows. Maybe it’s because the black dial goes so well with a black tie. Ask her, maybe she knows.\n So, not only is the Submariner a great watch to wear with a suit, but it is also because the steel against the black goes very well with a suit.\n [LINKED_TEXT: Here are the 33 most interesting facts about the Rolex Submariner.] [URL: http://millenniumwatches.com/facts-about-rolex-submariner/]\n Hope you found our answer helpful!\n"

    "question": "Why is Armenia so conservative?",
    "answer": "In a country that’s nearly 99% Christian, Christianity has played a huge role in shaping the identity of Armenia.\n The Armenian state was the first to adopt Christianity as its official state religion in 301 A.D, even before the Axumites in modern-day Ethiopia. The Armenians have a tradition of building stone “Khachkars” with intricate designs of crosses & Christian symbolism, many that continue to stand today are more then 1,000 years old.\nThe Armenian Apostolic Church is considered to be a part of what it means to be an Armenian. Much so that the rituals of baptism and the holy eucharist are seen as integral parts of Armenian culture.\n Most importantly, the church has long served as a stronghold and refuge for the Armenian people who’ve found themselves in the middle of competing empires over the last 2–3 centuries. After the Armenian genocide, the Catholicos (Patriarch) of the Armenian Apostolic Church canonized all 1.5 million victims as saints of the church. Today, the Armenian Church is estimated to have the largest number of saints on the planet, even more than the Catholic Church.\nWhile the Armenian state today is officially secular, the church is considered the most trustworthy organization in Armenia. The head of the church is also quite influential & has increasingly denounced the policies & actions of Pashinyan’s government. Catholicos Karekin II has quite blatantly stated that he believes that Pashinyan is leading Armenia down a path of destruction and a potential 2nd genocide.\n"

    "question": "What are some facts that sound like 'BS', but are actually true?",
    "answer": "Fascinating Facts About Space:\nVastness of Space: Space is unimaginably vast, with the observable universe spanning over 93 billion light-years in diameter. It contains countless galaxies, stars, planets, and other celestial objects.Empty Space: Despite its vastness, outer space is mostly empty. In the vast expanse between celestial objects, there are extremely low densities of particles, resulting in a near-vacuum environment.Extreme Temperatures: Space experiences extreme temperatures. In some areas, such as deep space, temperatures can drop to near absolute zero (-273.15 degrees Celsius), while in close proximity to stars or other energetic sources, temperatures can reach millions of degrees Celsius.Cosmic Microwave Background: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a faint radiation present throughout the universe. It is the remnants of the hot, dense early universe, and its discovery provided strong evidence for the Big Bang theory.Black Holes: Black holes are regions in space with extremely strong gravitational forces that prevent anything, including light, from escaping their grasp. They form from the remnants of massive stars that collapse under their own gravity.Time Dilation: The concept of time dilation states that time runs slower in regions with intense gravitational fields or high velocities. This phenomenon has been observed and confirmed through experiments and observations of fast-moving objects and objects near massive bodies.Cosmic Expansion: The universe is expanding, with galaxies moving away from each other. This expansion was discovered through observations of distant galaxies and is believed to have started with the Big Bang.The Speed of Light: Light travels at a staggering speed of approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (186,282 miles per second). This means that light from distant stars and galaxies takes a significant amount of time to reach us, allowing us to observe the universe as it was in the past.Exoplanets: Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system. Since the first confirmed discovery in 1992, thousands of exoplanets have been identified. They vary in size, composition, and distance from their host stars, raising intriguing possibilities for the existence of habitable worlds.Space Debris: Earth's orbit is cluttered with debris from old satellites, spent rocket stages, and other fragments. This space debris poses a significant challenge for space missions and can potentially collide with operational satellites.Astronomical Units: Astronomical units (AU) are commonly used to measure distances within our solar system. One AU is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, approximately 150 million kilometers (93 million miles).The Multiverse Hypothesis: The multiverse hypothesis suggests that our universe may be one of many universes that exist, each with its unique physical laws and properties. While still speculative, this idea is being explored by physicists and cosmologists.\n"

    "question": "Can someone who is well-informed about guns tell me all the terminology related to guns? For example, magazines, clips, assault rifles, assault guns, assault weapons, ARs, etc.",
    "answer": "Magazine: A typically box shaped metal or plastic container that holds ammunition to be used by a firearm. It completely encloses the ammunition. It is generally inserted into the firearm at some point, which draws ammunition from it.\nClip: Some form of metal clip which hold ammunition to be used by a firearm. It does not completely enclose the ammunition. Although it can be fully inserted into the gun, as in an M1 Garand, it is usually used to make loading the gun easier. It doesn’t actually get inserted into the gun.\nAssault rifle: A purely military term used to describe a particular type of rifle. The U.S. military defines it as a magazine fed select fire rifle, capable of full-auto or burst fire, which fires an intermediate power cartridge.\n Assault gun: Rarely used these days, an assault gun is a self-propelled gun, intended to fire explosive shells. It’s intended to support infantry when assaulting fortified targets such as buildings, bunkers, etc. The most well known is probably the German Sturmgeschutz used in WWII, which literally means “Assault Gun”.\nAssault weapon: An entirely fictitious term that was fabricated by the anti-gun left to describe a non-existent classification of firearms. It’s intended to make the uninformed public, who don’t know any better, believe that certain types of guns are somehow more dangerous and menacing than other similar ones. They seek to make people afraid of guns. Fear has always been a good motivator when used by corrupt governments.\n AR: Is simply a term used to describe any rifle based on the AR15 design.\n"

    "question": "What’s the major differences between an ENTJ and an INTJ?",
    "answer": "Both types are close since they rotate Te/Ni for dominant/auxiliary functions and if you are having difficulty finding your best fit type, that probably means you are not very introverted and having good social/communication skills. In this case it is getting a bit tricky.\n Several brutal tips can helps though.\nENTJs can’t stop. They have difficulty managing energy wisely and usually overextend themselves. They seldom need time for rest and they can go for days if get engaged in stimulating extroverted activities. That can result in a sudden but short energy collapse. ENTJs restore themselves fast and get back to normal. Their active/sleep regime looks rapid when they get overexcited with something.INTJs usually do take time to recharge no matter how exciting the project or activity is. Their active/sleep regime looks more regular. Otherwise, they rest a lot on the week-ends. This is the key difference between the two types.ENTJs have Fi for inferior function which means they seldom talk how they really feel or they may underestimate the personal impact of their actions on others.INTJs have Se as inferior function that can result in getting overloaded with factual data, detailed information, getting engaged in sensual pleasures or caught up in outbursts of anger/childish rebells.\nInferior function comes into play under stress.\n So, if you are more likely to never talk how you really feel under stress and you run around like an Energizer until you run out of your energy - you are ENTJ.\n If, you have more or less regular sleep habits because your body needs to, and under stress you are more likely to eat couple pizzas or burst into anger, you are INTJ.\n Good luck!\n"

    "question": "How do you calculate the mean absolute error?",
    "answer": "The mean absolute error (MAE) is a metric used to measure the average difference between the predicted and actual values in a dataset. It is often used to evaluate the performance of regression models. To calculate the MAE, you can follow these steps:\nCollect your dataset: Make sure you have a set of actual values (ground truth) and their corresponding predicted values. For example, you might have a set of actual housing prices and their corresponding predicted prices.Calculate the absolute error: For each data point, subtract the predicted value from the actual value, and take the absolute value of the difference. This will give you the absolute error for each data point.Absolute Error = |Actual Value - Predicted Value|Compute the average: Take the average of all the absolute errors calculated in the previous step. You can do this by summing up all the absolute errors and dividing the sum by the total number of data points.MAE = (1/n) * Σ(Absolute Error)Where n is the total number of data points in your dataset.Interpret the result: The MAE value represents the average magnitude of the errors in your predictions. It is measured in the same units as the original data. A lower MAE indicates better model performance, as it means the predicted values are closer to the actual values on average.\nNote: The MAE does not consider the direction of the errors, meaning it treats overpredictions and underpredictions equally. If you want to give more weight to larger errors, you might consider using other metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE).\n"

    "answer": "Applying aloe vera gel on the face overnight is generally safe for most people. Aloe vera gel is a natural moisturizer that is known to have many benefits for the skin, including soothing sunburns, reducing inflammation, and helping to heal wounds.\n However, it's important to be aware that some people may be allergic to aloe vera gel or may experience skin irritation from using it. It's always a good idea to do a patch test on a small area of skin before applying aloe vera gel all over your face, especially if you have sensitive skin or a history of allergic reactions.\n Additionally, if you have oily or acne-prone skin, applying aloe vera gel overnight may not be the best option as it could clog your pores and worsen your acne. In these cases, it's best to consult with a dermatologist or skincare professional to find the best products and skincare routine for your skin type.\n In summary, aloe vera gel is generally safe for overnight use on the face, but it's important to be aware of potential allergies or skin sensitivities, and to consider your skin type and individual skincare needs before using it.\n"

    "question": "If you are a medical worker, have you ever experienced a patient full out faking?",
    "answer": "This is a particularly appropriate question for an audiologist. Audiology didn’t exist as a profession in the early years of the Second World War. Not until, approximately 1943 or 1944, when an unprecedented number (hundreds of thousands) of men and women came home from the battle fields with irreversible noise induced hearing losses due to acoustic trauma, head injuries due Projectiles, brain damage due to aphasias. Overnight, the Veteran’s Administration started opening Hospital Clinics all over the United States for the rehabilitation of communication disorders. Audiology was born. The first Ph.D. in audiology was awarded at NorthWestern University in 1945. Many of these men and women went on to be evaluated, treated, and subsequently given compensation for their losses, The V.A. became the largest employer of audiologists. As time went on, however, ,ten, twenty years later, more and more, claims continued to be filed. It became evident a valid objective technique for assessing the actual degree of hearing loss was necessary. A direct measurement of hearing acuity that didn’t rely on patient response became available in the 1960’s. Evoked Potential Auditory Brainstem Response Audiometry was born, (BSER) followed almost immediately with OtoAcoustic Emmisiom (OAE) audiometry. Yet another objective test of hearing loss. These and a battery of other tests have drastically limited Functional hearing losses, psychogenic hearing losses, and outright malingering.\n"

    "question": "How can I lose 10 pounds in 3 weeks without exercising?",
    "answer": "Losing weight quickly can be tempting, but it's important to prioritize your health and safety. Rapid weight loss can be challenging to sustain and may have negative effects on your body. Instead, focus on gradual, sustainable changes to your lifestyle that promote healthy weight loss. Here are some tips to get you started:\nConsult a Healthcare Professional: Before starting any weight loss program, consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian. They can assess your health, provide personalized advice, and ensure you're approaching weight loss in a safe manner.Create a Calorie Deficit: Weight loss occurs when you consume fewer calories than your body burns. However, extreme calorie restriction is not recommended. Aim for a moderate calorie deficit by choosing healthier foods and reducing portion sizes.Eat a Balanced Diet: Focus on a balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Avoid highly processed and sugary foods.Control Portion Sizes: Be mindful of portion sizes to avoid overeating. Using smaller plates can help with portion control.Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Sometimes, thirst can be mistaken for hunger.Limit Sugary Drinks: Avoid sugary beverages like soda and fruit juices, as they can contribute to weight gain.Be Active: Incorporate regular physical activity into your routine. Aim for a mix of cardiovascular exercises (like walking, running, or swimming) and strength training to build muscle and boost your metabolism.Get Enough Sleep: Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Poor sleep can affect hormones related to appetite and weight gain.Manage Stress: High stress levels can lead to emotional eating. Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as meditation, yoga, or spending time in nature.Track Your Progress: Keep a journal or use a mobile app to track your food intake, exercise, and progress. This can help you stay accountable and make adjustments as needed.Avoid Fad Diets: Steer clear of fad diets that promise rapid weight loss but lack scientific evidence. They may be unsustainable and potentially harmful.\nRemember, healthy weight loss is a gradual process. [LINKED_TEXT: Aim for losing 1-2 pounds per week] [URL: https://www.digistore24.com/redir/283755/srikanthMalliswari/], which is considered a safe and sustainable rate.

If you are facing an issue with accuracy then analyse the mistakes you are making regularly.\n Select a mix of questions and set a limited time to solve them like in an examination scenario where you attempt as many questions in any order within the limited time. After that check your attempts and accuracy. Then analyse the questions which went wrong and what mistakes you made by referring the solutions. Then answer the following:\n Are you making conceptual mistake: If yes then study the chapter again from your material and attempt 5 similar questions after that to ensure your concept is clear. If no, then check which error are you making and where. Remember this mistake so that when you attempt similar question, you consciously avoid that mistake. Attempt 5–10 questions of similar pattern by avoiding the mistake and then you’ll overcome the habit.\n Make sure that in both cases when you attempt the said 5–10 questions, don’t set any time limit. First address the problem then again attempt similar questions in test environment.\n"

    "question": "What is the real meaning of friendship?",
    "answer": "In the wild during times of drought mothers will abandon their offspring and this is what happened to this little Hippopotamus in the picture above. Only a few days old, Charlie the baby hippo was orphaned after his mother could no longer feed him.\n Luckily for Charlie, rescuers found him and took him to an animal orphanage in Africa, where they nursed him back to health. About a week later Makhosi the Rhino was brought to the orphanage after its mother was killed by poachers. She was very traumatised and wouldn’t settle, so they decided to put her in the pen with Charlie the Hippo.\nHippo’s and Rhino’s are usually territorial and don’t normally get along. It didn’t take long for Makhosi to settle once she was in the pen with Charlie. For the first time since she arrived Makhosi was able to sleep. The Hippo and the Rhino became attached to each other which was strange because in the wild they would hate each other.\nCharlie followed Makhosi everywhere and even started to act like the Rhino. They did everything together, bath, eat, sleep and eventually with a Rhino for a best friend Charlie the Hippo began to believe he was a Rhino.\nCharlie began to hate going near the water because Makhosi would never follow him in. He would only eat when the other Rhinos ate and this was a problem, because if Charlie could never learn to be a Hippo he could never be released back into the wild.\n Luckily for Charlie the orphanage brought in another orphaned Hippo, a female called Moomin. It didn’t take long for Moomin to fall head over heels for Charlie and would even get upset if she saw him getting attention from some one else.\nThe more the two Hippo’s spent together the more Charlie began acting like a Hippo. He started going back in the water and even started to eat with Moomin.\n Even though Charlie was a Hippo again, he didn’t forget about his friend Makhosi. They would still hang out and they still took naps under the tree together. In early 2021, Makhosi was transferred to a game reserve with another Rhino that she got close to, where they started their transition back into the wild.\n Charlie and Moomin where released back into the wild in February of this year, they had spent 6 years together at the orphanage.\n"

    "question": "Do wind turbines use diesel?",
    "answer": "It’s hard to understand why you might even ask this question. No, wind turbines do not run on diesel.\n What you might be talking about is wind farms in general. A wind farm is like any power station: it has lots of machines which run on electricity. Lights, electronics, sensors, right down to the kettle in the staff room; they all run on electricity. Obviously they’re connected to the grid, so normally they just get power from that. When they’re generating that means they obviously power themselves, when they’re not they draw power from other generators. This is the same for any type of power station, and always has been.\n If a wind farm has any diesel generators on site they’ll be for emergency use when the grid goes down. If the grid fails all the turbines will have to stop generating because there’s nowhere to send the power. They’ll feather their blades a disconnect their generators. The whole thing shuts down, but you’ll still need to run things like warning lights on the turbines so that aircraft and ships don’t bump into them.\n Bringing power stations back online after a grid failure is called a black start and requires a certain amount of bootstrapping using backup devices such as gas turbines or diesel generators. But in ordinary operation, no wind turbines do not use diesel.\n"

    "question": "How does microbiology contribute to environmental sustainability through processes like biodegradation and bioremediation?",
    "answer": "Microbiology plays a crucial role in environmental sustainability through the processes of biodegradation and bioremediation.\n 1. Biodegradation: This is the process where microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and algae break down or degrade organic compounds into simpler, less toxic compounds. This method is commonly used to break down various types of waste, including municipal waste, industrial waste, and even specific components like plastics and hydrocarbons. By doing this, microbiology helps to reduce the amount of waste and pollution in the environment. The resulting products of biodegradation are usually water, carbon dioxide, and other simple compounds which are less harmful to the environment.\n 2. Bioremediation: Bioremediation is a process that uses microorganisms to remove or neutralize pollutants from a contaminated site. It is often used to treat environmental issues like oil spills, heavy metal contamination, and pesticide pollution. There are two main types of bioremediation - in situ and ex situ. In situ bioremediation treats the contaminated ground in the location it is found, while ex situ involves removing the polluted soil or water to be treated elsewhere. Bioremediation is considered more environmentally friendly than other remediation techniques as it harnesses natural processes to restore the environment.\n These processes have several benefits including cost-effectiveness, reduction in the use of harmful chemicals, and the transformation of hazardous waste into non-toxic compounds. However, they require careful monitoring as conditions must be optimal for the microbes to carry out these processes effectively. For example, factors like temperature, pH, and the presence of necessary nutrients can all impact the effectiveness of biodegradation and bioremediation.\n In conclusion, microbiology offers promising, sustainable solutions to some of our most pressing environmental challenges. By harnessing the natural capabilities of microbes, we can mitigate pollution and contribute to environmental sustainability.\n"

    "question": "What did Chuck Berry think of Elvis Presley?",
    "answer": "The answer to the question \"What did Chuck Berry think of Elvis Presley?\" is complicated. Berry had been sentenced to prison for robbing a bank in 1961, and he spent three years there. However, he successfully appealed this conviction, citing the disparaging comments of the judge as the basis for his conviction.\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, [LINKED_TEXT: Chuck Berry] [URL: https://youtu.be/EmO3NXnjf2Y] discussed his musical influences. In one instance, he mentioned Les Paul as an influence on his playing. The guitarist even said that the song \"How High the Moon\" by Les Paul inspired him. In another interview, he said that \"It was very beautiful.\" In response to a question about the influence of Mick Jagger on Berry, he scoffed.\n The music business was still very different in the 1950s than it is today, and racial prejudice was a major obstacle to Chuck Berry's success. His publicity photos were deliberately underexposed in order to make his skin tone appear lighter, a tactic that often backfired. For example, a Knoxville club booked him, thinking that he was white. He was then turned away.\n While Chuck Berry certainly knew that Presley was a trailblazer, he felt that achievability on the scale of Presley's was his to claim. In fact, in 1958, he ranked eight songs on the Hot 100, his most successful year.\n Chuck Berry was a prolific songwriter and guitarist. He took his country and blues influences and turned them into a new sound. He also influenced others with his lyrics, which were a mixture of subtle critique and wit. As a result, he helped pave the way for Bob Dylan. But in terms of style and music, he and Presley were very different.\n Chuck Berry was a fan of Nat King Cole, and he played blues songs by Muddy Waters and Jay McShann. In fact, he sang the famous \"Confessin' the Blues\" at school, which was considered inappropriate for a school event. While this might have seemed like an odd choice at the time, it was a big hit, and his popularity skyrocketed. In the '50s, Chuck Berry was a recognizable stage presence and an icon.\n Chuck Berry was considered one of the founders of [LINKED_TEXT: rock] [URL: https://youtu.be/EmO3NXnjf2Y] and roll. His style and talent helped bring the genre into the mainstream, and many people wanted to emulate him. In fact, John Lennon said that Chuck Berry's name stands for rock and roll, and his music paved the way for the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, and David Bowie, AC/DC, and so many more.\n Presley's music career began in the 1950s. He signed a recording contract with Sun Studios and made several hit singles. After the recording contract, Sam Phillips sold Presley's contract to RCA for $35,000, and Elvis was a big star.\n Want to know more about Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, John Lennon and [LINKED_TEXT: Rock History] [URL: https://youtu.be/EmO3NXnjf2Y] hit the watch button bellow!\n"

It might have been Hannibals sense that his field army would be chewed up in the rabbit warren of streets in Rome. It might have been an over abundance of caution, he had just won a smashing victory, why risk his irreplaceable men when they had just broken Rome’s back? It’s entirely possible that he believed that Rome would sue for peace in the aftermath of the victory, underestimating the stubbornness of the Roman character.\n That moment of delay and hesitation on his part likely changed the entire course of European history.\n"

    "question": "What is the difference between \"stylized\" and \"abstract\" in art?",
    "answer": "Stylizing is basically anything that deviates from reality. Cartoons are stylized, painting monochromatic is stylized, exaggerating shadows or light is stylizing, etc. Style is a particular way of making art that tends to have something of a signature effect. Abstract is a style in which the art does not represent actual things that exist in the real world, but instead uses shapes, lines, and colors for their own sakes.\n Here’s an example of something stylized:\nAs you know, humans do not come in shades of blue, orange, and purple naturally, nor are they naturally defined through brush strokes. These are all stylistic elements brought in by the artist, but the artist still made the effort to create something recognizable: a woman’s face.\n Here’s an example of something abstract:\nNotice how you can’t actually pick out any objects from the real world out from this painting. It is literally just colors and shapes on a canvas, made largely for aesthetics’ sake rather than to represent anything. This is the essence of abstract; if they ask you to parse out a very specific meaning from an abstract art piece (like “This represents how the artist felt after her divorce” or something like that), they’re playing a prank on you.\n"

Often a PM company only administers lease terms and collects rent but are not a “legal agent” or “party” to the lease contract.\n If they are not authorized to act as an agent or not a party to the lease, they may not have the authority to remove him. If this is the case you can seek an agreement with the actual owner to amend your contract and remove him. If you are agreeing to continue the lease commitment they may well agree.\n Having his name on the lease as an occupant is different form being a party to the contract. his name may appear as an occupant or dependant but if he did not sign, they may just wish to have more “names to hunt” in a default situation.\n If you are already ok with your son moving out and can carry the lease commitment out to the end on your own, his leaving should have little or no impact unless you default.\n Another simple solution is to find another room-mate with good credit and they will probably allow a substitution of co-tenant/ occupant.\n In some jurisdictions, if he was under 18, legally a minor or not of age to make or be party to a contract at time of entering the lease contract, it is possibly not binding.\n Good luck!\n"

    "question": "What should be the correct size for gym/ weightlifting gloves?",
    "answer": "The correct size for gym/weightlifting gloves can vary depending on the brand and individual preferences. However, to determine the appropriate size, you can follow these general guidelines:\nMeasure your hand: Use a measuring tape to measure the circumference of your dominant hand just below the knuckles. Make sure to measure around the widest part of your palm.Consult the size chart: Most glove manufacturers provide size charts that correlate hand circumference measurements with glove sizes. These charts can typically be found on the product packaging or the manufacturer's website.Consider fit and preference: Weightlifting gloves should fit snugly but not be overly tight. The gloves should allow for proper finger movement and a comfortable grip on the weights. Keep in mind that different brands may have slight variations in sizing, so it's a good idea to read customer reviews or try on gloves if possible.\nIt's worth noting that some individuals prefer not to use gloves while weightlifting, as they prefer the direct contact and improved grip with the weights. Ultimately, the choice of wearing gloves or not is a personal preference based on factors such as comfort, grip, and protection.\n To know more about the Boxing Gloves Size visit here:\n[LINKED_TEXT: Boxing Gloves Buying Guide | Beginners, Kids & Training - YOKKAO USAAre you looking for the best boxing gloves? or what size of boxing gloves should you get?

    "question": "Why is the microwave oven harmful to food?",
    "answer": "Microwave ovens have been a staple in many households for decades, offering a quick and easy way to heat up food. However, there have been concerns about the safety of cooking food in a microwave oven. In particular, some people worry that the radiation emitted by microwave ovens can be harmful to human health.\n The good news is that there is no evidence to suggest that microwave ovens are dangerous when used properly. The type of radiation used by microwave ovens is non-ionizing, which means that it does not have enough energy to break apart molecules or cause cellular damage. In fact, microwave ovens are considered to be one of the safest cooking methods available.\n That being said, there are some potential hazards associated with microwave ovens. For example, if the [LINKED_TEXT: microwave oven parts] [URL: https://www.partsips.com/amana-appliance-parts], such as the door or the seals, are damaged, then there is a risk of radiation leakage. This can be dangerous, so it is important to have your microwave oven inspected regularly to ensure that all parts are in good working order.\n Another concern is that microwave cooking can lead to a loss of nutrients in the food. This is because the high heat generated by the microwave oven can cause some of the vitamins and minerals in the food to break down. However, this is not unique to microwave cooking and can happen with any form of cooking that uses high heat.\n It is also important to note that some types of plastic containers can release harmful chemicals when heated in a microwave oven. To avoid this, use microwave-safe containers and avoid using plastic wrap or containers that are not specifically labeled as microwave-safe.\n In conclusion, cooking food in a microwave oven is generally considered safe, provided that the appliance parts are in good working order. While there are some potential hazards associated with microwave cooking, these can be easily avoided by using microwave-safe containers and regularly inspecting your microwave oven. So go ahead and heat up your leftovers without worry – your microwave oven is a safe and convenient way to prepare food.\n"

    "question": "How do people who eat only once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals?",
    "answer": "Eating only once or twice a day, also known as intermittent fasting, can be a great way to manage hunger and lose weight. But how do people who follow this diet manage to not feel hungry between meals?\n Well, staying hydrated is key. Drink lots of water or switch things up with some herbal tea or flavored water. This can help you feel fuller and prevent hunger pangs. Additionally, when you do eat, go for nutrient-rich foods like fruits, veggies, whole grains, and lean proteins. These will help keep you feeling fuller for longer.\n It's also important to choose low glycemic index foods and stay away from sugary snacks and processed foods, as they can cause your blood sugar to spike and then drop, leaving you feeling hungry again soon after eating.\n Mindful eating is another helpful practice. Slow down and savor your food. Pay attention to your hunger and fullness cues to prevent overeating. Planning is also crucial. If you know you'll only be eating once or twice a day, it's important to plan your meals ahead of time to make sure you're getting all the nutrients you need.\n It's important to keep in mind that intermittent fasting isn't for everyone, and it's crucial to listen to your body's needs. If you're unsure, it's always a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to make sure you're meeting your nutritional needs.\n"

    "question": "Did classical composers first compose the piece as a piano piece and then transform (arrange) it to a fully orchestral piece?",
    "answer": "Not typically, no. Some composers did turn works for piano into orchestral pieces — Ravel is well known for this — but most orchestral music tends to be conceived orchestrally from the outset.\n Composers have differed in their approaches to coming up with full orchestral scores. Sometimes a draft or a series of sketches are made in which there are quick notes about the plans for orchestration, which are then fully executed in a later pass over the music to produce the finished version, a little like a pencil or ink study in preparation for a painting. And sometimes composers work out the details in their heads, writing straight into a full score, watercolors and all. Which method works best depends on both the composer and the nature of the music.\n Reverse-engineering orchestral music into piano solo or duet arrangements — the opposite of the process suggested by the question — was common in the mid-to-late 19th and early 20th century. The publishers of Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Dvorak, Debussy, Stravinsky, and many others of that era often insisted on the creation of such arrangements, done or at least supervised by the composers themselves. The income stream generated from a symphonic work could be augmented (exponentially) by play-at-home arrangements. These sold quite well among curious enthusiasts in the days before recording and broadcast.\n"

    "question": "What is the biggest problem with the modern education system?",
    "answer": "Do you know the United States spends more per students on education than any other country in the world? Despite its commendable academic infrastructures, the country faces challenges in terms of educational diversity and student welfare. If you are eager to know what is wrong with the current education system in the United States, then invest some time in reading this blog for in-depth analysis and knowledge.\n 1. Cost of tuition is high\n This is one of the most alarming limitations when it comes to talking about the challenges faced by the education system in the United States. The cost of tuition is said to be high as compared to other countries. So much so, the tuition fees apparently go upward with $45-50,000 per year. If students need to spare such hefty amounts to support their tuition's, then how will they afford other expenses such as college fees, admission costs and the likes?\n 2. Teaching diversity is one alarming factor\n The courses in the education system in the United States are subjected to high diversity. This has resulted in each of the 50 states offering a substantially different syllabus and academic norms based on the same field of study. Now, this is creating discrepancies and gaps in teaching as contents tend to differ from one university to the other.\n 3. Limited employment opportunities for international students\n Apparently, the United States has certain immigration restrictions for the international students. This has led to complexities in terms of international students seeking admission in US universities and looking for employment opportunities post graduation.\n So, if we are to consider the factors as mentioned above, then it seems that the country is in some serious needs for revamping the way its government looks at education-based prospects.\n"

    "question": "Why did punk rock die?",
    "answer": "One could make the argument that “punk rock” is more of an approach to something, usually (but not necessarily) music, rather than a genre. In this sense, it remains quite popular, particularly in urban areas around the world.\n The emphasis in such cases is on spontaneity, retaining a rough, unfinished feel to the finished product, embracing a sense of ragged, second-hand, repurposed style (ie “thrift-store chic”), and advancing some type of socio-political agenda.\n With this understanding, one could see that “punk rock” continues to remain popular in various forms like spoken word street poetry, visual art, culinary endeavors, social organizing, and yes, rock and roll bands.\n When someone turns a vacant building into an improvised art and performance space, that is punk rock.\n When someone organizes a group to protest income inequality (or some such social cause) and does so without a formal meeting space, agenda or even a consistent roster of members, yet manages to maintain a recognizable public presence of some sort, that is punk rock.\n When someone turns their garage into an impromptu restaurant featuring young, relatively inexperienced culinary staff and scraping together whatever local ingredients they can from unconventional suppliers, that is punk rock.\n When someone creates their own “radio station” with a bunch of past-its-sell-by-date equipment, a closet sized studio space in a corner of a repurposed warehouse, and an all volunteer staff of untrained broadcasters, that is punk rock.\n And of course, whenever a group of teenagers gathers to compose music with only rudimentary musical skills, performs in public, and makes recordings on a shoestring budget, that is still punk rock.\n"

It is not even a competition. \n \n \n US has 11 aircraft carriers. India and China together have 2 and those are smaller ones. US has 139 stealth aircrafts, while India & China have none.

US can observe any part of the world through its satellites and hit any part of the world with its ICBMs. Thus, any country that even proceeds in US direction will be gone before they even start operation. And you need to cross a large ocean to reach the US. \n It would be a folly for any group of countries to attempt to attack US on its own soil. And no one is even remotely considering it.

    "question": "If there are big cats, why are there no big dogs?",
    "answer": "The difference in size between big cats and dogs is largely due to evolutionary and ecological factors.\n Cats are solitary hunters, and larger body size can help them take down larger prey. Larger size also makes them more intimidating to other predators, which is important for their survival. As a result, natural selection has favored larger body size in many cat species, such as lions, tigers, and jaguars.\n Dogs, on the other hand, have evolved to hunt and scavenge in packs. In this social context, cooperative behavior and intelligence are more important for survival than physical size. As a result, natural selection has favored traits such as loyalty, obedience, and the ability to work with others, rather than body size.\n Additionally, the environments in which dogs and cats evolved have also played a role in determining their size. For example, smaller dog breeds may have been selected for their ability to fit in small spaces, such as dens, to hunt or protect their owners, while larger dog breeds may have been selected for their strength and ability to guard livestock.\n In summary, the difference in size between big cats and dogs is due to a combination of evolutionary, ecological, and selective pressures that have favored different traits in each species.\n"

    "question": "Why are Siberian Huskies abandoned in large quantities?",
    "answer": "To echo many of the answers here: because they are at the intersection of the kind of dogs that many, many people think they want, and the kind of dogs that are far too difficult and time consuming for most people to fit into their lives comfortably.\n Most people don’t really have the resources to take care of huskies: they require a ton of exercise, lots of space, and lots of constant stimulation. Since most people live in the cities or suburbs and have 9–5 jobs, they just aren’t capable of giving that kind of dog what it needs to be happy and healthy.\n Unfortunately, they also are a very popular dog breed to adopt because they are extremely good looking dogs and sort of look like what most people think they want in a dog. Add to this the fact that, when understimulated, they can be downright dangerous (Huskies are one of the breeds genetically and temperamentally still closest to wolves), and you can see how many people come to regret to decision to acquire a Husky.\n There are also two other strong factors that influence this kind of regretful turnaround: the first is that Huskies hate heat. Much of the US is pretty warm, at least in summer, and Huskies will be fairly uncomfortable in most climates. Relatedly, Huskies are very difficult to groom properly. They have thick, multilayered guard hair coats that require constant brushing and frequent trimming. Most people have no time, money, and inclination to put up with all of this.\n In short, huskies are easy to adopt but hard to take care of, a combination which makes for a lot of jettisoned pups.\n"

    "question": "Is marijuana legal in Washington, DC?",
    "answer": "n 2014, Washington, D.C., passed Initiative 71, which allowed adults 21 years and older to possess and cultivate small amounts of marijuana for personal use. This initiative was approved by a majority of D.C. voters in a ballot measure. However, it's important to note that Initiative 71 did not establish a legal framework for the sale or commercial distribution of marijuana.\n The process behind this legalization was somewhat nuanced. Initiative 71 was able to move forward and become law due to the unique status of Washington, D.C. as the nation's capital. The district operates under a different set of legislative rules, which grants it limited autonomy in enacting local laws.\n While federal law prohibits the regulation and taxation of marijuana, the D.C. Council used this limited autonomy to pass Initiative 71, focusing on personal possession and cultivation rather than commercial sales. This allowed the district to navigate the legal complexities and effectively decriminalize the recreational use of marijuana within its jurisdiction.

Even Lord Budhha is said to been born in a republic of the Sakya clan in Kapilavastu . The leader of the republic was called Rajan as well but he was merely the first among equals and thus not a true monarch .

The leader of this committee was the Rajan . The committee oversaw all the functions of the state through sub committees made of groups from the central committee . These areas included taxation , defense, administration , urban upkeep etc . The Budhha was said to have been so impressed by the Lichhavis that it is said he modelled his Sangha along similar lines. When Ajatsatru wanted to establish the sway of Magadha , he asked Budhha for advice on how to defeat the invincible Lichhavis.

Since everybody gathers around the baggage carousel, the bags get claimed quickly. and most baggage claim areas are only a few feet from the exits.\n Security officers may question anyone loitering in that area who looks out of place, and they may spot-check baggage claim tickets. The fact is, there are too many people and a 100% check would take too long.\n"

    "question": "When is noon: 12:00-12:01, 12:00-1:00, or the exact second of when the clock strikes 12:00?",
    "answer": "“Noon” is a word that changed it’s meaning over centuries.\n From [LINKED_TEXT: Origin and meaning of noon by Online Etymology Dictionary] [URL: https://www.etymonline.com/word/noon]:\nmid-12c., non \"midday, 12 o'clock p.m., midday meal,\" from Old English non \"3 o'clock p.m., the ninth hour,\" also \"the canonical hour of nones,\" from Latin nona hora \"ninth hour\" of daylight, by Roman reckoning about 3 p.m., from nona, fem. singular of nonus \"ninth\" (see [LINKED_TEXT: nones] [URL: https://www.etymonline.com/word/nones?ref=etymonline_crossreference]).\n The sense shift from \"3 p.m.\" to \"12 p.m.\" began during 12c., and various reasons are given for it, such as unreliability of medieval time-keeping devices and the seasonal elasticity of the hours of daylight in northern regions. In monasteries and on holy days, fasting was ended at nones, which also perhaps was incentive to push it forward. Or perhaps the sense shift was based on an advance in the customary time of the (secular) midday meal. Whatever the cause, the meaning change was complete by 14c. (the same evolution is in Dutch noen).\nAs an international startdard, when the clock hits 12:00, it will be “noon”. That’s all you need to know.\n A2A, thanks [LINKED_TEXT: Kyle Licht] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Kyle-Licht-1]\n"

    "question": "What type of government is in Starship Troopers?",
    "answer": "In the book, it is a Federal Republic with representative democracy, but with restricted citizenship and franchise.\n It is the type of restrictions which makes it different from other kinds of representative democracies. The United States of America started out with many restrictions on voting rights and citizenship, and excluded the vast majority of its adult population. This changed over time, but within the class of citizens able to vote, there usually are no requirements other than legal adult age.\n The Federation was formed as a world unifying government, and had a specific goal to ensure that its citizens and government would only include people who volunteered to serve the population of the nation. Anyone who volunteered for Federal Service and completed one two year term would be granted citizenship, and could vote and hold public office.\n Federal service includes many things, mostly not military combat service. But it always includes basic military training, and as a volunteer, if a war or disaster or other emergency requires dangerous work or combat, you have to do it.\n Or else, resign, and give up your chance to become a voting citizen.\n It shares some ideas in common with modern nations which implement universal conscription, which have the expectation that most adult citizens will have spent some time in service practicing to defend their country.\n Except that instead of demanding that it's citizens “volunteer”, the Federation makes it a choice. Those who choose Service are presumed to be more likely to be good public representatives when elected, and responsible informed voters, rather than unfocused ignorant slackers.\n Because the book focuses on a group of soldiers during a war, we don't see much of the civilian side of the government. We do know that no active military service members may vote or hold public office, as they only can be Citizens after completing service.\n Other than the citizenship requirement, we get little hint that the government is repressive or unresponsive to the desires and needs of the whole population, citizens and non citizens alike. All have American style civil rights, can own businesses, property, and live pretty much as they please, within the law.\n"

    "question": "What is rent seeking? Why is turning a profit on ownership not a good thing?",
    "answer": "This is one of many terms in economics that means something different than its normal English meaning.\n In English, rent means a periodic payment for a physical good—an apartment, a car, a tuxedo, etc. There is nothing wrong with that.\n Economist David Ricardo defined “rent” as payment beyond what is required to keep a factor of production in current use. This differs from normal English in two ways. First, it applies to all factors of production, including payment for labor (which in English we usually refer to as wages or salary rather than rent) and other services. Second it is only the excess, not the full payment. So if you rent your apartment for $1,000 per month, but the landlord would be willing to keep renting it to you for any amount above $900, the Ricardian rent is $100, not $1,000.\n Ricardian rent is not necessarily wrong, but you have to inquire the reason for it. If it results from arms-length negotiation between two parties, then it’s fine. But if it results from some illicit force—say racial discrimination or laws favoring one party or the other—it’s bad.\n Economist Anne Krueger in 1974 introduced the term “rent seeking” to refer to people seeking benefits from politics. This is Ricardian rent in the sense that people seek to be paid for goods or services at above the market rate. They want no-bid contracts to supply the government overpriced goods, or cushy no-work jobs or consulting gigs, or special tax breaks, or their competition to be handicapped, or an infinite number of other schemes.\n Of course, not everyone agrees what behavior is rent-seeking. A lobbyist working to impose regulation on an industry will probably claim she is trying to protect the public and improve quality, while others will say she is trying to get rules that will increase profits for her clients at the expense of the public and competitors. A teachers’ union negotiator will say he is trying to get a fair deal for teachers in the best interests of everyone, while others will say he is trying to trade teachers’ votes and union dues to corrupt politicians for sweetheart contracts.\n"

    "answer": "Elements of Indian Classical Dance have been beautifully enumerated in Abhinaya Darpana. However in Natyashastra the elements have not been explicitly described. They are similar for all classical dance forms in India.\n Elements of Indian classical dance as per ‘Abhinaya Darpana Prakasha’ are divided into three distinct categories, namely, ‘Natya’, ‘Nritya’ and ‘Nritta’. ‘Natya’ is related to drama and ‘Nritya’ to the gesture accompanied by a musical composition. ‘Nritta’ refers to pure dancing where the body movements do not express any meaning. All these aspects use movements of the limbs and poses of the human body as their medium.\n The universal root of all Indian classical dance forms can be related to ‘Bharata’s Natyashastra’. According to the ‘Natyashastra’, Lord Brahma is the originator of the Universe and he has created the drama. The Indian classical dance forms are directed by the essential elements of an act with ‘abhinaya’ and ‘rasa’.\n For more, visit the links below:\n [LINKED_TEXT: Elements of Indian Classical Dance, Indian Dances] [URL: https://www.indianetzone.com/50/elements_indian_classical_dance.htm]\n [LINKED_TEXT: Indian classical dance - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_classical_dance]\n"

    "question": "What is the diference between ethical hacking and cyber forensics?",
    "answer": "Ethical hacking and cyber forensics are both integral components of the cybersecurity landscape, but they serve distinct purposes within the realm of digital security.\n Ethical Hacking:\n Ethical hacking involves authorized attempts to breach computer systems, networks, or applications to uncover vulnerabilities. Ethical hackers, also known as \"white hat\" hackers, use their skills to identify potential weak points in a system's defenses. Their goal is to simulate real-world cyberattacks and provide insights into how malicious hackers might exploit these vulnerabilities. Ethical hacking aims to proactively strengthen security measures and prevent potential breaches before they occur.\n Cyber Forensics:\n Cyber forensics, on the other hand, focuses on investigating and analyzing digital evidence after a cyber incident has taken place. This could include cyberattacks, data breaches, hacking incidents, or any form of digital crime. Cyber forensics experts collect, preserve, and examine digital evidence to determine the scope of the incident, identify the source of the attack, and gather information that can be used in legal proceedings. Cyber forensics plays a crucial role in understanding the nature of cyber incidents and aiding in the pursuit of justice.\n In summary, ethical hacking is a proactive approach aimed at identifying and patching vulnerabilities before they are exploited, while cyber forensics is a reactive approach focused on investigating and analyzing digital evidence after a cyber incident has occurred. Both disciplines are essential in maintaining the security and integrity of digital systems and data.\n"

    "question": "What is the Mongolian word for 'author'?",
    "answer": "Sandblasting\n Sandblasting or air-abrasion is one of the most common methods used for surface preparation. This technique has the advantage to create homogenous and anisotropic surfaces even on hard materials like ceramics or glasses. Indeed, it creates scratch-like irregularities using a high-speed stream of solid particles propelled by compressed air to remove unfavorable contaminants, increase surface energy, bonding surface area, and surface roughness (Fig. 6).\n[LINKED_TEXT: Welcomehttps://www.sciencedirect.com/user/login?returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Ftopics%2Fchemistry%2Fsandblasting] [URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/user/login?returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Ftopics%2Fchemistry%2Fsandblasting]Fig. 6. Scanning electron microscopic views of zirconia with three different surface topographies (machined, polished, and sandblasted) under 500 and 10,000 magnifications.Adapted from Nothdurft, F.P., Fontana, D., Ruppenthal, S., et al., 2015. Differential behavior of fibroblasts and epithelial cells on structured implant abutment materials: A comparison of materials and surface topographies. Clinical Implant Dentistry and Related Research 17, 1237–1249. doi:10.1111/cid.12253.\n Alumina particles are usually used for their low cost, hardness, and needle-like shape but fractures can happen sometimes due to its brittle behavior. It is possible to tailor the obtained topography by varying parameters such particle size, particle shape, kinetic energy, pressure or impact angle. Moreover, the solid particles have to be clean as well as uniform-sized for the preparation of proper surfaces and the choice of the different parameters must avoid excessive damage to the material surface (Ebnesajjad, 2014; Soon et al., 2016; Papageorgiou and Pandis, 2017).\n It has been shown by Nothdurft et al. (2015) that a rougher surface obtained by sandblasting has favored the adhesion of fibroblast on zirconia. Nevertheless, the use of sandblasting can alter the surface chemistry by alumina contamination but this issue can be resolved by acid etching treatment. Indeed, this technique, discussed in the following section, can allow to remove surface residues\n"

    "question": "Every year, the top 5 mutual funds changes. How can we select in a particular fund for a longer period of 15+ years?",
    "answer": "Just like direct equity, brokerages and research houses declare a list of top or hot Mutual Funds. These are based on research and rankings provided by some institution like Morningstar or Value Research.\n These ratings keep changing over a period of time, depending upon the market conditions, the performance of the fund over a period of time, etc. They are just an indication of the performance and it would be risky to follow these ratings and decide the investment.\n There are many factors that go into the selection of a Mutual Fund and they are the performance ratios like the Sorento Ratio, Beta, Alpha, etc which one needs to understand in order to select the fund. However, there is no guarantee that the hot fund or the recommended fund that is performing today will perform tomorrow.\n Therefore it would be naive to rely on the ratings alone and make the investment. They may give an broad understanding to the direction, but ultimately one needs to check his or own judgment also and analyze the risk factors associated with the fund before making the investment.\n [LINKED_TEXT: Financial Resources That Make A Difference…] [URL: https://tinyurl.com/ygvx22z7]\n"

    "question": "Have the Democrats ever been as far to the left as they are in the 2019/2020 election cycle?",
    "answer": "Questions like this show just how far out of touch the U.S. electorate is with the rest of the world.\n We barely even have a left-wing party in the United States. What we really have is a far-right one and a center-right one. Bill Clinton’s triangulation strategy pulled the Democratic Party hard to the right, and it hasn’t really recovered. As a result, and thanks to court rulings that determined money is speech, both major parties are now full of politicians who serve wealthy corporate interests rather than the interests of the people.\n And so we end up with Democratic politicians who talk a progressive game and then get elected and tell us why we just can’t afford to have affordable education or single-payer healthcare. And the candidates who really would bring about significant change to the system — like Tusli Gabbard and her opposition to our interventionist foreign policy — are by turns smeared and ignored by the corporate media that serves up propaganda for the ruling class.\n Bernie would be center-left in any European democracy. That’s about as “extreme” as the Democratic field gets. Maybe they seem far left because the Republicans have moved so far right. But perception is not necessarily reality.\n"

    "question": "Is investing in cryptocurrency still profitable?",
    "answer": "Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens that utilize cryptography to secure and verify transactions and regulate the creation of new units. While Bitcoin is the most renowned cryptocurrency, many other cryptocurrencies exist in circulation.\n The key appeal of cryptocurrencies is their potential to offer a decentralized alternative to conventional currency systems by operating on blockchain technology without the involvement of intermediaries like governments or central banks.\nWhile some view cryptocurrencies as a valuable investment due to their unique properties and potential to disrupt traditional financial systems, others see them as speculative assets with an uncertain future.\n It's important to note that investing in cryptocurrencies involves risks, as they are a developing technology. Cryptocurrency markets can be highly volatile, prone to rapid price fluctuations, and lack tangible assets or government backing, making them susceptible to hacking, fraud, and other risks.\n To make an informed decision about investing in cryptocurrencies, potential investors should consider their investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. It's also essential to conduct thorough research and seek advice from a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.\n"

    "question": "How have you, as a survivor of narcissistic abuse, detached yourself from the trauma bond that is formed as a result of the abuse? And how do you move on in everyday life?",
    "answer": "You do it by remembering who you are when you aren’t focused on what games the loon is playing and walking on eggshells, which becomes your reality when you’re with one of these creatures. It happens gradually and then quickly, the realization that there is nothing you can to do ‘fix’ this person followed by being either so exhausted of the constant abuse or so fed up that you actually do the complete right thing and stop trying. You focus, finally, on protecting yourself from any more. Unfortunately, a person isn’t ready to realize this until the abuse is so extreme by the end, and they realize there is nobody in there that they were ever connected to in the first place. This is a really hard realization for normal people. Knowing that someone thrived on deceit and then systematic, constant harm in every aspect of their interaction with you. It’s the diametric opposite of love. So you are flabbergasted that you ever saw them as something else, someone you loved and that you thought loved you. They are truly murderers at heart, murderers of the spirit of happiness, of trust, of goodness.\n You move on when you realize that you got through it and you stop feeling ‘scared’. They want you to worry about what will happen to you, and somehow it works. But only for a while. More time goes by and you realize they got nowhere in destroying you. You’re still here and you are now able to have a normal life again, which you have a deeper appreciation of. You also can see these monsters coming a mile away from now on, it’s like a new gift. It would be better if there weren’t such monsters among us, but since there are, you’ve got the know-how and armor now to survive life and remain in-tact. Which makes you a badass. And they’re still an evil loser who will wind up alone.\n"

    "question": "Why did Kavanaugh say that Americans have a right to privacy after protestors ruined his meal at a steak house when he was part of the majority SCOTUS opinion that overturned roe on the basis that the constitution doesn't grant a right to privacy?",
    "answer": "Not only is that not was he said, not what the ruling said but also one has nothing to do with the other.\n Roe was overturned because Congress failed to make abortion a federal law, all rights belong to the states unless Congress passes a law that supersedes the state's rights. And they have to do it while conforming to the requirements of the Constitution.\n Leftists in Congress for decades have tried to avoid their responsibility and step up and own responsibility for their political views and rhetoric. They often try to pass off their job to the courts because it's easier to do and easier to hide behind. The courts correctly returned the responsibility to the States. It is their right and obligation to pass laws based don't the will of the people in that state. Again until Congress does its job and pass the laws its voters want then the state’s rights take precedence.\n Congress knows this, the media knows this. But it’s always been easier to say all kinds of nonsense, wring their hands, create hate and division, and rile up the masses but fail to do their jobs.\n And none of that has anything to do with privacy rights.\n"

    "question": "Why is Akshay Kumar fit?",
    "answer": "Akshay Kumar has been a fitness freak since the very beginning of his career in 1990s. Akshay doesn’t believe in exercising in a set way as it becomes boring and monotonous, hence he is not a big fan of gyming. He believes in staying fit the natural way, along with following a strict and disciplined schedule. He loves making his work outs a lot more adventurous and fun by playing basketball, practicing kick-boxing, practicing yoga, swimming and lots of martial arts. He believes in not sticking to just one routine and try variations amidst nature. He does not work out for more than 45 minutes to one hour five to six times a week.\nAkshay Kumar has always shared that it is not just exercise, but also a healthy diet that keeps him fit. Here are some rules that he follows to stay in shape.\n 1. Never eat after 6:30 P.M. It is important to give rest to your stomach. Food takes 4-5 hours to digest and so it is best to eat early so that your body can finish digesting the food and kick start again in the morning.\n 2. Don’t believe in protein shakes, as it may have side effects in the long run.\n 3. Sleep early and start your morning as early as possible but don’t overexert your body.\n 4. Control your sugar and salt intake; the lesser you take, the healthier you are.\n 5. Try and meditate for at least half an hour, so as to get some peace of mind. Meditation also helps in reducing stress levels.\n 6. Always keep a container full of nuts and fruits with you. So, if you feel hungry, you know what to turn to.\n 7. Drink a lot of water; at least 4-5 liters daily.\n 8. Try keeping your metabolism rate high by eating healthy and half of your fitness and weight problems will be solved. Generally, he eats a bowl full of fresh fruits after his lunch and only eats green salads and soups for dinner as they are easy to digest.\n 9. Don’t overeat as you expand your stomach’s capacity to fill in more food. Try eating less that your gut gets used to small portions.\n 10. If you cannot exercise, just take a quick walk for about 15-20 minutes every day to ensure some physical activity.\n you can come to know more about him on :[LINKED_TEXT: Join Xpert to Help Everyone Learn from the Best] [URL: https://www.xpert.chat/?ref=XoI7]\n also connect to him on [LINKED_TEXT: Akshay Kumar teaches Acting via Xpert] [URL: https://www.xpert.chat/p/akshay-kumar]\n"

    "question": "Should liberals really be held responsible for the actions of AntiFa? I thought left-anarchism viewed liberalism as a tool of capitalism and statism.",
    "answer": "Militant Antifascists (aka Antifa, not AntiFa) are not liberals. In fact many Antifascists view liberals as the primary enablers of Fascism and are often antagonistic toward liberals and their sensibilities. Liberals are quick to denounce any militant antifascist action with appeals to pacifism and collaboration with fascists. Antifascists on the other hand understand from history that allowing fascists to have any platform whatsoever is not an option.\n Furthermore, all Anarchists are left (or post-left). There is no such thing as right-wing Anarchism aside from internet fads. Anarchism has historically always been and will remain anti-capitalist, anti-fascist, anti-state and feminist. The recent internet fads of “Anarcho”-capitalists and other right-wing political trends are the result of co-option of Anarchist imagery, slogans etc by right-wing propagandists. Murray Rothbard infamously wrote about deliberately appropriating the term Libertarian as well, which has historically always been a synonym for Anarchist.\n"

    "question": "What are some short stories about wives?",
    "answer": "Arun and Anagha were married for fifteen years, now. Their wedding was fixed according to the Indian tradition of arranged marriage. Anagha was the niece of a family friend and was suggested to Arun's family as a prospective bride.\n \n \n The two families met at  the friend's place and neither Arun nor Anagha had any misgivings left about meeting the right person at the right time. The twosome tied the knot on the auspicious day chosen by the family astrologer. The wedding was solemnised with pomp and gaiety!\n The couple shared perfect compatibility. Arun was a college professor and his job was respectable as well as remunerative. Soon, they could fulfill all their dreams and aspirations. They owned a bungalow and a car, maintained a decent lifestyle, were blessed with two sons and lived as a perfectly happy family. On weekdays, they would be busy in routine and weekends were meant for outings with friends, small excursions or cycling, swimming and sports.\n Everything was picture perfect. On one Saturday evening, Arun had a bash with his male friends and came home tipsy. But that was nothing unusual, as Anagha had taken his occasional boozing in stride. Reminding her to wake him up early the next morning, so that he could go swimming with his friends, Arun was already snoring within minutes of lying on the bed.\n \n \n The next morning, he got ready and called out to her from the drawing room that he was leaving. Anagha was busy in the kitchen. She took a few minutes to come out and on her entry in the drawing hall, saw Arun sprawled on the floor. She frantically called out for help. To her horror and the consternation of the entire family and friends, Arun was declared 'brought dead ' by the hospital staff.\n Life, suddenly came to a standstill. A numbness overtook Anagha's being. She had never learnt to be on her own without him. Her two boys, aged 13 and 5, clung to her all the time. They simply were at a loss to know what should come next. Life had to be lived, although, the shine from their existence had gone. After numberless days of uncontrollable wailing and mourning, one morning Anagha woke up to her stark reality. Her soulmate, her alter ego was gone forever, but had left behind two wonderful gifts in flesh and blood-her two sons. She could not ignore them for her husband who had left on the road of no return!\n \n z\n Turning down all propositions for remarriage, her sons became the sole purpose of her existence. Now, she has begun to live, believing that Arun is still with them and life is perfectly normal. He was her loving, loyal, selfless husband and would always have loved to see her living a life of dignity. She still wears her wedding necklace and sports a bindi on her forehead. Afterall, Arun is alive every moment- in her memory!\n"

In the Middle Bronze era this was conveyed by a channel (covered with rock panels) to a pool—an antecedent to the Roman aqueducts. Under King Hezekiah, around 700 BCE, to enhance water security and prevent access to the water by besieging enemy forces (like the Assyrians) this was replaced with a winding tunnel—533 metres long, at a very gentle incline, carved underground within the rock, from the spring to a pool at the southern end of the city, known in as Siloam Pool (in Hebrew, Breikhat Hashiloaḥ):\nAstonishingly, this was excavated from both ends of the route, with the workers meeting precisely in the middle.\n For more information in English, see: [LINKED_TEXT: Gihon Spring - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gihon_Spring] and [LINKED_TEXT: Siloam tunnel - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siloam_tunnel]\n"

    "question": "How does the Canadian healthcare system prevent people from going to the doctor excessively when they aren't sick, with no copays and deductibles?",
    "answer": "Most people don’t want to go see doctors for no reason. In most cases, Canadian health care would probably want people to see doctors more often for preventative type care — health, fitness, mammograms, yearly checkups, shots, etc.\n However, assuming someone tried this.\nAppointments. Non-emergency doctors run private practices. They may not be able to see new patients and existing patients have to set appointments. This could be weeks or months in some places to see your doctor.Hospitals and Clinics. If you show up at an emergency room or a clinic without any issues… you are treated in terms of priority. Depending on where you go, you could wait the entire day and not see a doctor. Few sane people want to sit in an ER room for eight hours.Referrals. You can’t make appointments with specialists or for any procedure. These need to be arranged through a GP first. So… all you can get is maybe 15 minutes of a general doctor’s time. They can look at you, look at your history, don’t see anything and that’s pretty much it. The aren’t going to run you through an MRI, see a specialist, etc.Medial Tracking. Each province maintains records for patients across the province. If you see a doctor they (or typically their receptionist) can look up all your visits. In practice, after a half-dozen repeated “no issue” visits someone is going to flag you and folks are going to know. They might still meet you if they aren’t doing anything.Physiocratic Services. If repeated visits happen too often, a doctor can refer you to mental health specialists.It’s cheap. Doctors in most provinces are billing maybe $70-$100 per fifteen minute visit. Even if you managed two bogus appointments per month for a year before someone flags you for mental health help… that is still under $2,000 per year. It is a faction of the national average and such a tiny drop vs. people who don’t see a doctor and develop really serious issues. If one in a thousand or ten thousand people have such mental health issues to go through the trouble of getting a 15 minute appointment, it isn’t financially going to strain the system vs. even one guy who keeps putting off a prostrate exam and then the added cost of dealing with late term cancer or something.\n"

    "question": "How do you prove that \"G is connected\" is not equivalent to any sentence in first-order graph theory?",
    "answer": "To prove that the statement \"G is connected\" is not equivalent to any sentence in first-order graph theory, we need to show that there is no formula in the language of first-order graph theory that is logically equivalent to the statement \"G is connected.\"\n First, it's important to note that the statement \"G is connected\" is not a sentence in the language of first-order graph theory. This is because the language of first-order graph theory consists only of predicates, variables, and logical connectives, and does not include the concept of a graph being connected.\n However, we can still try to express the idea of a graph being connected using the predicates and logical connectives available in the language of first-order graph theory. One way to do this is to define a predicate \"Connected(x,y)\" that is true if there is a path in the graph from node x to node y. We can then use this predicate to express the idea that the graph is connected by saying that for any two nodes x and y in the graph, there is a path from x to y.\n However, this formula is not logically equivalent to the statement \"G is connected.\" This is because the formula only states that there is a path between any two nodes in the graph, but it does not capture the idea that the graph is one continuous whole. For example, a graph could have two separate connected components, but the formula would still be true because there is a path between any two nodes in the graph.\n Therefore, we can conclude that the statement \"G is connected\" is not equivalent to any sentence in first-order graph theory.\n"

    "question": "How is it that the Turkish economy is not collapsing while the Turkish lira is losing value? Why is there no economic crisis in Turkey?",
    "answer": "Because currency depreciation and inflation is a double edged sword, where the effects are often time-lagged.\n In the short run it can look like a good thing. The falling value of the lira makes Turkish exports cheaper, so they sell more. The below graph shows Turkish exports as a percentage of GDP.\nThe relative fall in 2020 is due to the the pandemic. And all in all, these numbers look really good.\n But a fall in the lira's value also means that imports are more expensive. And Turkey imports a lot. Especially energy. The difference between import and export is called the current account. If it's a positive, then Turkey export more than it imports. If negative, then it imports more than it exports. The graph below shows the current account.\nAs you can see, it's negative. Turkey is importing more than it can export.\n So the the fall on the lira isn't yet resulting in a current account plus. Now how are Turkey then paying for these excess imports?\n It borrows. And it mainly borrows from foreign sources, since Turkish people aren't saving enough to make up for the cost of the import. Both Turkish national debt and private debt measured compared to GDP is rising. And the cost of this borrowing will have to be paid at some point.\n It's not a problem if the economy is growing faster than the rate of borrowing. But a high inflation, which are connected to the falling lira hurts GDP growth. A consistent very high inflation as Turkey have been experiencing in the last year have numerous bad side effects, which only slowly shows it self. This the bad time lagged part of the double edged sword.\n Some economist would argue that this is already taking place. The below graph shows yearly growth in GDP, meausered as a percentage of last year's GDP.\nAnd there does appear to be a downward trend. In 2019 Turkey was really close to one definition of recession, which is growth below 1.5% of GDP.\n TL;DR: High inflation and currency depreciation looks good in the short run. It have really bad effects in the long run. Turkey is postponing the “bad\" part by borrowing and (by printing). Turkey doesn't have to face economic collapse, but it's definitely dancing on the edge of recession. When a recession inevitable comes, the damage done to the Turkish monetary system will make it even harder to get out of.\n"

    "question": "Whats the #1 thing you always pray for?",
    "answer": "There has been many smart maneuver in business if had to pick one than it would be :\n In 2007, Netflix made a daring move that changed the face of entertainment forever. Originally a DVD rental-by-mail service, the company's visionary leader, Reed Hastings, saw the writing on the wall.\n With the internet advancing at breakneck speed and people craving instant access to movies and TV shows, he knew it was time for a major shift. Netflix went all-in on streaming technology, pouring resources into creating a powerful platform that could handle colossal amounts of data and deliver crystal-clear video to viewers across the globe. But they didn't stop there.\n They began snapping up licenses for films and TV series, and soon ventured into producing their very own original content, like the smash hits \"House of Cards\" and \"Orange Is the New Black.\" These exclusive shows set Netflix apart from the competition and drew in hordes of subscribers. This bold strategy sent shockwaves through the home entertainment industry. DVD rentals and sales plummeted, and media giants scrambled to keep up with the streaming revolution.\n Today, Netflix reigns supreme as the global leader in online streaming, boasting over 200 million subscribers and inspiring a wave of new platforms like Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+. Netflix's fearless embrace of streaming technology catapulted the company to the forefront of the entertainment world, perfectly positioning them to ride the wave of change and dominate the industry.\n"

    "question": "Japan, the Korean Peninsula, and Vietnam have all tried removing the extensive use of Chinese characters from their language. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this shift?",
    "answer": "Unlike Vietnam and Korea, Japan is not trying to abolish the use of Kanji. Perhaps you are mistaken.\n First, we must assume that Japanese is a completely different language from Chinese. It is more remote than that of Dutch and English.\n The biggest difference is that Chinese and Japanese differ in the order in which verbs come. At this point, the Japanese language can no longer be described solely in Chinese characters.\n It is also important to note that China and Japan exist differently. Some things are unique to Japan, while others are unique to China. Chinese vocabulary alone cannot explain some things in Japan.\n On the other hand, Japanese is a language with a very small variety of sounds. Among them, intonation, which is used in Chinese to indicate differences in meaning, is used in Japanese only to indicate fluency.\n Hiragana and Katakana were created to absorb many of those differences. However, even excluding the fact that they were created based on kanji, without kanji it would be very difficult to produce sentences with few misunderstandings. This is something that anyone who begins to learn Japanese quickly realizes.\n Today, Japanese and Chinese kanji are not exactly the same. This is because first Japan and then mainland China began simplifying their Chinese characters to avoid making learning difficult with complex designs.\n Japanese people can read, if not write, at least 90% of Taiwanese Chinese characters that have not been simplified, but sometimes cannot read Chinese characters from mainland China.\n"

    "question": "What is the endowment policy of LIC, and is it a good policy?",
    "answer": "Greetings,\n It is never a good idea to take endowment plans of any company.\n In the case of LIC, these plans have many variants - Jeevan Pragati, Jeevan Labh, Jeevan Anand, etc. Other insurance companies also sell similar products in the name of Double Income, Guaranteed Lifelong income, Money Back, etc.\n Sold as a combo of insurance and investment, these plans typically have an emotional appeal and complicated payout structure.\n But the truth is the sum assued as insurance is never good enough for anyone’s family in case of their untimely death. And the returns earned rarely beat inflation or FD.\n Yet, they are pitched in such a manner that many people fail to see how poor these products are.\n The pitch goes:\n You pay a certain amount as a premium for multiple years.\n In case of your unfortunate death, your family will get the insured amount.\n Otherwise, on maturity, you will get the money back with “interest and bonus”.\n Here’s an example.\n Pay Rs 1 lakh annual premium for 12 years. Post that, from the 13th-17th year, the insurer will pay Rs 1.3 lakh a year. Next, from the 18th-22nd year, you will get Rs 2.6 lakh a year. Plus, you get an additional Rs 2 lakh at the end of the 22nd year.\nAmazing, right? Your money is getting nearly doubled! But here is the catch. If you calculate the average annual return, you are getting only around 5%.\n So you are barely beating inflation. In fact, the return is less than FD. Therefore, never go by the sales pitch or the numbers that the agent or advisor shows you when buying insurance or any mutual fund product. Always understand the payout structure.\n If you had invested the same amount in market-linked products like Mutual Funds or NPS, you would have earned much higher returns. And for insurance, you should always go for Term Insurance plans as they offer adequate cover for at a very low perimium. For example, if you are 35-year-old non-smoker, you can get Rs. 1 crore cover at an annual premium of Rs. 15,000–20,000.\n This way, you will have the right mix of investment and insurance to secure your financials.\n Hope this helps!\n If you learned something new, UPVOTE and SHARE to help us reach more readers\n To learn more about personal finance, Follow us: [LINKED_TEXT: ET Money] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/ET-Money-4].\n"

    "question": "How did video game developers make gaming look realistic when computers back then couldn’t even handle basic visuals without slowing down significantly?",
    "answer": "By using a number of ways, video game creators have been able to make gaming seem realistic, including:\n * Three-dimensional modeling and rendering: This process entails building models of objects and surroundings in three dimensions and rendering them in real time. Although this uses a lot of processing power, the graphics it produces are astoundingly accurate.\n * Texture mapping: Textures are added to 3D objects to make them look more lifelike. From hand-drawn art to pictures, textures come in many different forms.\n One of the most crucial components of video game realism is lighting. Lighting may be utilized to accentuate significant things, establish the mood, and create atmosphere.\n * Post-processing: This entails adding finishing touches to the produced picture after it has been created. This may include elements like anti-aliasing, bloom, and depth of field.\n Computers weren't strong enough in the past to handle these methods in real time.\n As computer technology has advanced, game creators have been able to utilize ever-more-advanced methods to produce more lifelike games.\nHere are some concrete instances of how game designers have improved the realism of gaming throughout time:\n * Early 3D models for video games were relatively basic and low-poly. As technology advanced, engineers were able to produce increasingly intricate, detailed models.\n * Simple graphics, often pixelated or hazy, were employed in early video games. Developers were able to employ higher-resolution textures that were more realistic and detailed as technology advanced.\n * Simple, flat, and unnatural lighting was often employed in early video games. With increasingly advanced technology, developers could use lighting methods that produced shadows, reflections, and ambient light that were more lifelike.\n * Post-processing effects were not used in the first games. As technology advanced, designers could utilize post-processing techniques to provide a more realism and theatrical appearance, such as depth of field, bloom, and anti-aliasing.\nThese are just a few instances of how game designers have improved the realism of gaming throughout time.\n Future video games are likely to be ever more lifelike and engaging as computer technology advances.\n"

Because if you understand karma, you really understand who and what you are, and you understand the rest of the universe too, because the laws of karma are universally applicable.\n [LINKED_TEXT: Karma] [URL: https://www.getwisdom.com/] means action. Physics shows that for every action, there must be an equal and opposite reaction. Karma is energy, which in itself is neither good nor bad; these are just the labels people choose to attach to it.\n When you perform an action, it creates a memory, which in turn generates a desire, which leads you to perform another action. For example: You take your first yoga class (action), then you know what happens in a yoga class (memory), and if you enjoyed the class, you decide to go back the following week (desire), and that following week you turn up again with your mat (action). Karma creates memories and desires, which then determine how you live. Actions, memories, and desires are the Karmic software that run your life.\n Karma cannot be avoided. For most people, Karmic energy is returned with the same intensity with which it was generated. Depending on your previous actions, this could create happiness or suffering. Whatever happens, is the result of Karma being released, which, no matter how you view the situation, is a good thing and an opportunity for future growth.\n"

    "answer": "Cats have certain migration instincts that are hard-wired into them. When the conditions are met, they feel driven to move on.

If you live in a hard water area, then a cheap water filter will solve the problem.\n Overcrowding - In the wild more cats arriving puts a strain on the food supply. Older or less fit cats may feel the need to leave. In the modern world your house only has enough cat food to feed the existing number of cats (because that’s all you give them). Overfeed cats for a week or two when you get another cat, dog, baby, or other new arrival, and make sure you spend at least some time fussing over the cat, and they should feel less threatened. Note this also works with small children who may not be overjoyed at the new arrival.\n Pregnancy - Cats will often leave if they get pregnant, looking for a new home that has more food and/or space, and fewer potentially dangerous inhabitants.

    "question": "How did aboriginal people not leave a bigger mark on the Australian landscape despite living here for over 60,000 years?",
    "answer": "Two reasons:\n (1) The Aboriginal people managed the land in a very sophisticated way, not by using fences and earthworks like the British invaders, but by selectively using fire, and utilising indigenous plants, and manipulating grazing animals to their advantage. So successful was it, that one early explorer, seeing how everything seemed carefully laid out and designed, called it “the biggest estate on earth”. However this order was destroyed by ignorant settlers herding thousands of hard-hoofed animals across the land which hardened the soil, killed native vegetation and disrupted the status quo. Any signs of previous civilisation were obliterated by the settlers who wanted to propagate the myth of “Terra Nullius”, an empty land devoid of previous owners.\n (2) While some structure were for human betterment, many of the large enduring structures in other continents came out of three suspect impulses – defence (castles/walled cities), self-aggrandisement (palaces/monuments) or religion (temples/shrines). The aboriginal people had successfully evolved a culture that obviated all of these. The tribes and nations largely lived in peace in their traditional lands. SInce they did not ‘own’ them, but were rather ‘owned’ by them, they could not be taken from them and the whole concept of conquest was rendered meaningless. So no defences needed. The culture was collectively governed by tradition, as kept alive by the elders, so there was no opportunity for self-aggrandisement. Everything you did was for the land and the people, not for selfish motives. And the land itself, ‘country’, and various features of it, were the spiritual basis of the culture, so the land itself and its physical features were the temples and shrines. Building human spiritual structures would have been absurd.\n So the “mark” the Aboriginal people left was a 60,000 y. o. peaceful culture that conserved the land rather than exploited it, and this was too subtle for the self-described highly-civilised Europeans who arrived here to notice, and it was easily over-run by a people whose weapons of destruction had been honed by many centuries of conflict and death.\n However, while the “marks” of aboriginal civilisation may not be as prominent as elsewhere on the planet, the lessons to be learned from it may far exceed them.\n Further Reading: Bill Gammage “The Biggest Estate on Earth”, A & U, 2011.\n"

    "question": "If \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" was made on a budget of $275 million, then gained $393 million worldwide, why is it considered a box-office failure? If somebody gave me $118 million, I wouldn't sneer and say, \"That's not enough.\"",
    "answer": "Because $275 million was not the budget. It was the production budget. That does not include the marketing budget and as the other answer to this question states it does not include the percentage of ticket sales that movie theaters keep. And that percentage is different for every country. Not only that, there is the potential for backend points, basically deals that directors for actors make for a percentage of the box office. All of that comes into play.\n In the US alone the percentage of ticket sales kept by the theaters ranges from 20–50%. There is no set percentage and numerous film pundits state it to be within that range.\n And it is even more so for different countries. Take China for example, China keeps 75% of the box office gross made there. Only 25% comes back to the studios. And Star Wars has performed poorly in China.\n So that $393 million is split into $213.8 million domestic and $179.1 million in foreign box office.\n And let’s lowball this estimation. Let’s say that the domestic theaters only took 20% of ticket sales. That’s $42.76 million right off the top. So all that is left domestically is $171.04 million.\n Now lets do foreign box office. Again every country is different but generally more than domestic so rather than attempt to get the breakdown for every country let’s just say that the take is 60% across the board. That is $107.46 million. Leaving $71.64 million in foreign sales.\n That is leaves a total of 171.04 + 74.64 = $245.68 million\n And again since the marketing budget was never stated lets lowball it and say it is $100 million. For a blockbuster Star Wars film that is a lowball estimate. So $245.68 - 100 = $145.68 million.\n Now we have to take out the production budget so $145.68 - 275 = -$129.32 million dollars.\n A loss of $129.32 million dollars. And that is using lowball estimations/numbers in regards to % of ticket sales taken domestic and foreign, and the marketing budget.\n"

    "question": "Do people in the United States actually believe that gun reform will cause them to lose their right to own a weapon?",
    "answer": "“Do people in the United States actually believe that gun reform will cause them to lose their right to own a weapon?”\n Look at history. Governments throughout the world have controlled whether their people could own weapons. In the nations where theownership of weapons was allowed, reform has always ended with the people being disarmed.\n Now, look throughout history at the number of mass murders/mass shootings that have occurred. You will discover that the great majority of them were committed by government forces against unarmed people. The first mass shooting in American history occurred in 1770, in Boston. Known as the Boston Massacre, nine British soldiers killed five protestors, each one a British subject, and injured twenty nine others, while only one soldier received minor injuries. What were they protesting? Taxation and confiscation of weapons. For those who say that could never happen now, look at Kent State University in 1970, when the National Guard opened fire on peaceful student protestors. Yes, this happened in the United States. Look at Tienanmen Square back in the late 1980s. Ten thousand peaceful student protestors fired upon by Chinese infantry and tanks. The sad part is that, even today, the Chinese government still believes that it was a good way to handle the situation.\n"

    "question": "Where has Indian media gone wrong?",
    "answer": "The performance of Indian media, like media in any country, is a topic of ongoing debate and criticism. There are various aspects to consider when assessing the performance of Indian media:\nMedia Pluralism: India has a diverse media landscape with numerous outlets representing different perspectives, languages, and regions. This pluralism allows for a wide range of information and viewpoints to be presented to the public.Journalistic Standards: The quality of journalism in India can vary significantly. While some media outlets uphold high standards of journalism, others have been criticized for sensationalism, biased reporting, and lack of fact-checking.Political Influence: Some critics argue that certain media organizations in India might be influenced by political parties or corporate interests, which can lead to biased reporting and lack of impartiality.Responsibility and Sensationalism: There have been instances where Indian media has been accused of prioritizing sensational news over more substantive and critical reporting, which can impact public perception and understanding of important issues.Misinformation and Fake News: Like in many countries, India has grappled with the challenge of misinformation and fake news spreading through social media and some media outlets, which can have serious implications for public discourse and decision-making.Media Ethics: Issues related to invasion of privacy, aggressive reporting tactics, and unethical practices have been raised concerning certain sections of the media.\nIt's important to note that the Indian media landscape is vast and diverse, with many reputable and responsible media organizations that adhere to high journalistic standards.

    "question": "My manager said she is not able to keep my position anymore but asks me for a resignation letter. Am I fired, or did I quit?",
    "answer": "It sounds like your manager is asking you to resign from your position, which would mean that you are quitting your job. However, the circumstances surrounding your departure could be important in terms of your future job search and unemployment benefits.\n If your manager is asking you to resign, it's important to clarify the reason why. If you are being asked to resign due to performance or behavioral issues, it may be viewed as a termination rather than a resignation. In this case, it may be in your best interest to seek legal advice or consult with your human resources department.\n If you are resigning voluntarily, it's important to provide a written resignation letter that outlines the reasons for your departure and expresses your gratitude for the opportunity to work for the company. This can help to maintain a positive relationship with your employer and can be important for future job references.\n It's important to clarify the terms of your departure and to understand how it will be characterized for future employment and unemployment benefits. If you have any concerns or questions, it's a good idea to seek legal advice or consult with your human resources department.\n"

    "question": "What tactical maneuvers did the Ancient Roman Legion develop to counter the Parthian cavalry after the Battle of Carrhae?",
    "answer": "Countering horse archers with heavy infantry boils down to:\nIgnore them\nSeriously, that’s the best way how an army can deal with horse archers. Sure, you’ll rise your shield to interdict incoming projectiles and reduce your losses. But that’s pretty much all you need to do. Ignore them and they’ll go away. Yes, you’ll lose some men, but far fewer than if you did anything else. They have a limited supply of arrows and an even more limited supply of strategic depth. March onwards and take the objective, horse archers harass, not defeat.\n If you absolutely do have to fight them, if you face a large force with integrated horse archers, there’s a ready-made solution for that too.\nArchers\n Rome employed a wide range of auxilliaries, one of them were archers of Syrian tradition. They could outshoot the Parthian horsemen. If they tried to charge and ride them down the legions would be just behind, ready to take the blow and take the horsemen apart if needed be. Formed up infantry will break the cavalry charge, no matter what their weapons are.\n Horse archers are a useful tactical unit, harassment from afar with mobile forces can be devastating to an invader, but ultimately they’re just one of many in an arsenal and to fight Rome you’ll need to use several at once.\n"

    "question": "If getting investment in a startup requires disclosing everything about your business to potential investors, couldn't one of them just start the business without you?",
    "answer": "The US Patent Office has about a zillion listings for companies that never came to be. If you read a few, you’ll be surprised about how reasonable—and even potentially ground-breaking—many seem to be. If one were interested in stealing an idea, that would be fertile ground to till.\n Good ideas are a dime a dozen. Unless your company has actually discovered a cure for cancer (or the coronavirus), investors are far less interested in your idea, and far more concerned with your ability to execute. Can you get along with your co-founder (assuming you can find and inspire someone for that role)? Can you build a team? Can you raise seed capital? Can you build out an MVP? Can you connect with a robust market? Can you handle the inevitable ups and downs, the heart-breaking disappointments, the endless hours you toil away, the miserable salary you’re giving yourself?\n Do you have a strong enough ego to believe in your mission, in the face of the most daunting odds? Can you rein in your ego when the market is telling you you haven’t found product market-fit? Are you open to a pivot when you discover you’ve built a solution that’s searching for a problem?\n If you have success, and more incredibly, if you have an exit, it is almost axiomatic that the company you’re selling/taking public will barely resemble the company you first started. The company you were so concerned about protecting. Businesses aren’t murdered. They commit suicide. What is the stuff you (and your co-founder(s) are made of? This is what an investor is looking to steal.\n"

    "question": "In the US, is it better to send your kid to a public or private school? Are private schools better than public schools?",
    "answer": "Singapore is a great place to find the right kind of educational institution for your child. It has many choices for Schools and higher universities both in the public and private sector which make it easier for a lot of parents, especially the ex-pats. Public schools in Singapore mostly follow the local curricula where their language of instruction is mainly English with options for second languages like Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. However, they follow the bilingual program which emphasizes both English and mother tongue at the same time. And children have to attempt the primary school leaving examination when they finish primary school. On the contrary, Private and Indian international schools have much more diverse curricula with the options of CBSE, IGCSE, and IB which are influenced either by their home country’s education or a blend of the different international curricula. This can be beneficial to most students who wish to pursue professional degrees at a later point in life. Some of the best Indian Schools in Singapore offer Curricula like CBSE, IGCSE, and IB programs. It is very convenient considering that students have an option to switch between these curricula in these schools particularly like Global Indian International School, as they offer many curricula under one roof which can be a boon for students who are still not sure about what they would want to pursue at a later point in their careers. They also offer something known as the Bridge program where students are allowed to join in the middle of the term due to certain personal reasons. This program ensures that the student is helped with his academics to cover his previous lessons and reach the same level as his peer group. If you are looking for a program that sets you up for an international platform, then private schools are a good option.\n"

    "question": "How can I transfer ownership?",
    "answer": "Transferring the domain name from one registrar to another is an easy process and is mainly required when we get better pricing and improved services and features. Moving a website name allows you to change your registrar while retaining full domain name ownership.\n However, for domain transfer, you must follow the step-by-step domain transfer process. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to transfer a domain name:\n 1. First, check whether your domain name is eligible for transfer. The eligibility should have been registered for at least 60 days, not within 15 days of expiring.\n 2. If eligible, obtain an authorization or EPP code from your current domain registrar; this code will act as the security code for starting the transfer process.\n 3. Choose a reliable domain registrar to whom you want to transfer your domain name.\n 4. Initiate the transfer process with the new registrar by providing your domain name details and authorization code.\n 5. An email notification on record will be sent to the domain's administrative email address. Confirm it by clicking on the provided link.\n 6. Completing the transfer process may take a few days, so maintain patience.\n 7. After successfully transferring the domain name, it is time to update your DNS settings and transfer the website to a new domain with the new registrar and ensure everything works properly.\n By following these steps, you can easily transfer a domain name. And selecting reputable domain registrars like FreeParking makes this process smoother and less hassle-free with their premium customer and technical support quality.\n"

    "question": "Some people argue that developers should not be involved in testing their own codes but that all testing should be the responsibility of a separate team. Give arguments for and against testing by the developers themselves?",
    "answer": "The point is, if you write your code, you know exactly how to write the tests for it.\n The problem is that if you wrote the code, if you made a mistake in implementation or logic, that won’t be caught by your test, because you wrote the test to validate your code. Fundamentally to make it easy to understand, you took a picture of something as reference, and use that to compare it to all other pictures; but since you took the picture wrong; all the comparisons using that picture will also be wrong in their outcome.\n You need the developer to write unit tests; because they can do that while they develop the code (TDD is even better, but takes a lot of efforts); while the validation of the code should be left to someone else. It is common practice to have multiple layers of validation for code; so that makes sense and it is easy to implement.\n Who wrote the code can write unit tests, they can validate the code against their logic, and at least catch any error that is just a minor issue or a typo, if the compiler didn’t catch it before running the unit tests; each developer should always test his/her code before merge to the common repo.\n Then you have the actual testing for validation, which is usually written by automation engineers, and that validate not only the “contract” (what the dev said that function will do, return and accept as parameters), but also what the devs can’t anticipate, like merging with other components or libraries, inconsistencies in the logic, incompatibilities and so on. Functional tests and workflow tests are there for that reason, because even if your code takes 2 numbers and return a sum as float or int; and your unit tests are passing, that won’t go that far if your function is used to get floats as input for another function or process.\n TL:DR, you need both testing at dev level with unit tests and at automation level with functional and workflow testing\n"

    "answer": "The five-star hotel is luxuriously decorated. They are distinguished by the presence of gyms, spas, swimming pools, gardens and shopping complexes. Most five-star hotels are indeed competing with each other to offer more and more luxury and thrills. Some five-star hotels offer additional services such as limousine service, dog walking service, and medical services. They usually offer a selection of pillows to choose from. Five-star hotels are luxury hotels, so they have all the amenities you need. Even though it is a 7-star hotel, there is no public institution that provides 7 stars. Stars are usually given from 1 to 5. 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest. So you can see that 5-star hotels are the best. So why do some hotels call themselves 7-star hotels? A 5-star hotel offers every comfort, but a 7-star hotel does it more luxuriously. There are not many 7-star hotels. The Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai is said to be a seven-star hotel.

A great hack to keeping your bathroom clean and tidy is to wash it while showering.\n Since you’ve already got the shower going, scrub the floor and the sink, use toilet cleaner and wipe down the mirror once you’re done with your shower.

At that time there were only some 2000 engineering colleges in India and most of the engg. grads got respectable jobs just after a single degree.This SINGLE degree transformed an average student even most of them were not so gud into a skilled manpower.Companies hire them frequently especially if they were from IIT's or REC's(NIT's) .Most of the Parents want their children to be  working in a reputed [LINKED_TEXT: firm.So they choose engineering as background.] [URL: http://firm.at/]\n Now after 2000 there was a boom in engineering colleges.Every year lakhs of students got admit into engg. courses even if they weren't interested but because they were told to do so(off course by their parents).But this traditional thinking is changing nowadays.Today students don't think engineering as the only option after 12th.They are moving towards new areas where they can show their talents,earn a lot of money also.\n AMERICA :- In case of America,its a developed country .If someone wants to become an architect or fashion designer,they have ample opportunities as their industrial development is diversified .They spend lots of money on quality research ,so one can have a career in teaching line also.In NUTSHELL there is scope for everyone in his/her field of interest.\n"

    "question": "Why does Transcendental Meditation smell like a scam? Is this trademarked, paid program for real, or are they piggybacking on the general meditation trend?",
    "answer": "Everything which is real and pure today is put in the corner of suspicion and scam. Look at the world today, its ruled by narcists, fake news supporters and lyers like Donald Trump.\n Maharishi brought total purity and total unconditional love with his perfect system of TM and Vedic Science. That is suspicious in today’s world, because the world as a whole is still in a terrible state of mental darkness.\n But due to Maharishi’s programs the world is now changing very rapidly to higher pure levels of human behaviour. But it really costs a lot of effort. Millions of people around the world do there TM programs every day. Thousands of Maharishi Vedic Pandits recite the primordial sounds of the Veda every day.\n These unseen and practically unnoticed efforts are increasingly building up a force so strong, that it will make all those negative forces impossible to come up again. That will, at last, result in a world where real and pure knowledge will be evaluated as the only truth. Maharishi called that “Heaven on earth”.\n As long as that turning point is not reached, Maharishi and TM will be opposed. That’s the natural proces of stress release, which has to take place.\n"

    "answer": "It depends because the whole before the Red Wedding still leaves open a good solid 40+ year windows worth of time for when Roose Bolton can be killed.\n And really it depends on when exactly this is going down\n Is it before the Battle of the Green Fork?\n Then absolutely\n A little after the Battle of the Green Fork?\n Still it totally would\n After the fall of Harrenhal?\n Yup\n After the Battle of Duskendale?\n Hard to say…\n Before the Battle of the Mummer’s Ford?\n It’s tricky\n Just a few days before the Red Wedding?\n With regards to the Wedding, no, but long term absolutely\nThe problem is that this requires us to truly be in the head of Walder Frey, Lame Lothar Frey, and Roose Bolton, and some of the other main planners of the Red Wedding.\n During the Wedding we do have a lot of ambiguity surrounding the command structure of the Bolton men and what they were doing during the Red Wedding.\n There is the possibility that without Roose there to be in control of the Bolton forces that the wedding falls apart completely. And if Roose dies earlier before some of the previous battles, could likely mean there’s no consideration for a Red Wedding at all.\n So it’s a bit hard to say with this.\n"

    "question": "How do you know that you have found a true friend?",
    "answer": "True friendship is reciprocal in nature, both sides are equally interested in each other. True friends would not only ask how you are doing but they would also ask what’s been going on in your life since the last time you heard from each other. True friends give each other feedback, help each other and don’t only profess with their lips but also by their deeds that they are there for one another. True friends trust and cherish each other and to be honest isn’t an issue but an enrichment to them. Friends are reliable and truthful.\n There’s no room for dominance, tricks and power play in friendships. It wouldn’t even cross their minds to desecrate their friendship by such sinister behaviors.\n One friend’s joy is the other friend’s joy and one friend’s sorrow is the other one’s sorrow. Friends don’t necessarily have similar personalities but usually there’s at least one interest that they have in common, something that brought them initially together.\n Friendship is always of an adding nature, what’s being gained is inspiration besides spending time together, having fun and interesting talks.\n Inspiration comes from within an individual and directs one’s focus inwards, allows an individual to come in touch with their own authentic being, which is the difference between inspiration and infatuation btw, because infatuation is directed outwards, away from the individual and this results in self-alienation. Not so with true friends who inspire each other.\n True friendship is a deep connection between two individuals who are not dependent on each other and who meet each other on eye level. True friends are committed, loyal and truthful.\n A true friend is someone who knows the other friend‘s good and bad character traits but chooses to stay their friend - despite of that and exactly because of that. In a true friendship, everyone can come as they are. With friends, one can be authentic and real.\n Therefore, friendship can be seen as a form of love, but without the infatuation, restrictions, dependencies and regulations that comes with romantic love. No wonder that Nietzsche said of marriage that it first and foremost requires a talent for friendship.\n Not everyone is blessed with this talent.\n"

    "question": "The Mahabharata",
    "answer": "Most Powerful Warrior In Mahabharata\n It is difficult to determine who was the most powerful warrior in the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, as the text often emphasizes the prowess of different characters at different times.

    "question": "Is a 4k 120Hz 50-inch TV good at a distance of 7 feet from the screen for gaming?",
    "answer": "A 4K 120Hz 50-inch TV can be a good choice for gaming, especially if you have a distance of 7 feet from the screen. Here are a few factors to consider:\n 1. Resolution: The 4K resolution (3840 x 2160 pixels) of the TV will provide sharp and detailed visuals, especially when combined with the smaller screen size of 50 inches. This higher pixel density ensures that you can fully appreciate the level of detail in games.\n 2. Refresh Rate: The 120Hz refresh rate allows for smoother motion and reduces motion blur, which is particularly beneficial for fast-paced action games. It provides a more responsive and fluid gaming experience. However, it's important to note that not all games and consoles support a 120Hz refresh rate. Make sure your gaming setup can take advantage of this feature.\n 3. Viewing Distance: At a distance of 7 feet from the screen, a 50-inch TV will provide an immersive gaming experience. You should be able to see the details clearly without straining your eyes or losing visual fidelity. However, individual preferences may vary, so it's worth considering your personal comfort level and visual acuity.\n 4. Input Lag: Input lag refers to the delay between your actions (e.g., pressing a button on your controller) and the corresponding response on the screen. For gaming, it's crucial to have low input lag to ensure quick and accurate response times. Look for a TV with a low input lag rating specifically designed for gaming to enhance your gaming experience.\n 5. Additional Gaming Features: Some TVs come with specific gaming features, such as variable refresh rate (VRR) technology (e.g., AMD FreeSync or NVIDIA G-Sync), which helps eliminate screen tearing and provides smoother gameplay. These features can further enhance your gaming experience if your gaming setup supports them.\n Ultimately, the suitability of the TV for gaming depends on your personal preferences and requirements. It's recommended to research and read reviews of the specific TV model you are considering to ensure it meets your expectations regarding picture quality, gaming features, input lag performance, and user experience.\n"

    "question": "How much fuel did/does the Hubble Space Telescope need?",
    "answer": "The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope does not operate with fuel. The engineers of both NASA and the European Space Agency ESA knew that this would be a terrible idea. Using fuel to manoeuvrer creates a very short lifetime for a telescope. Also, rockets don’t burn smoothly, no matter how hard you try, so the telescope would shake every time it would get pointed to a new target.\n Instead of fuel, Hubble uses solar energy, reaction wheels and gyroscopes to operate:\n GyroscopesGyroscopes maintain orientation and provide stability in boats, aircraft and spacecraft based on the principles of angular momentum. You can experience this effect by holding a bicycle wheel by its axle and asking someone to spin the wheel. If you try to move the axle of the spinning wheel, you will feel a force opposing your attempt to move it. This force is similar to the one produced in the gyroscopes when Hubble moves.Each gyroscope contains a wheel spinning at 19,200 revolutions per minute inside a sealed cylinder. This cylinder is immersed in a thick, motor-oil-like fluid. Fine, hair-like wires, surrounded by this thick fluid, carry electricity to the motor. Oxygen-pressurized air, used to force the thick fluid into the float cavity that contains these wires, has corroded the wires and caused them to break. Pressurized nitrogen, used in the new gyroscopes, will eliminate the introduction of corrosive oxygen.\n Reaction wheelsHubble uses four reaction wheels, which are large, massive wheels that spin under the control of Hubble’s computer, to rotate around itself. If one of the reaction wheels turns clockwise, Hubble will turn counter-clockwise. The combined changes in the spin speeds of the wheels allow Hubble to manoeuvrer to point at different locations. The four reaction wheels are each approximately 0.6 metres in diameter, but in microgravity they can move the school-bus-sized Hubble because of their high spin rate and their mass.\n"

    "question": "What wind speed cancel flights? What is the highest wind speed in which a plane can land?",
    "answer": "It's not the speed that restricts the aircraft landing or departing as much as it is the wind velocity (speed and direction).\n With the wind blowing directly down the runway, departing and landing can be safely done at relatively high wind speeds, depending on the plane. Taxiing on the taxiways may be more of an issue.\n With the wind blowing across the runway, either perpendicular to the runway or some degree of angle, this is where velocity becomes very important. Each aircraft is rated as to the maximum wind velocity allowed before the landing/departure is aborted, and a chart showing just that is available for every model of aircraft. Normally, the higher the wind speed, the less angle of direction, will be allowed. It is left to the pilot to determine whether the activity can be safely executed.\n Smaller aircraft are far more susceptible to high wind velocities. You are probably asking about large commercial aircraft. These planes can accommodate much higher velocities. Check YouTube out, they have some great crosswind landing videos.\n"

    "question": "What is the reason for the 4 seasons?",
    "answer": "The plane where the earth is orbiting the Sun is called the ecliptic plane. Now, as you can see in the picture, the Earth’s axis is tilted about 23° away from this plane:\nSo what happens is that every half year, when it’s mid summer, Earth’s axis point maximally in the direction of the Sun. This means that half a year later, sometime in december, Earth’s axis is pointing maximally away from the Sun, which means we have winter here in the north hemisphere. In the spring the Sun is in between the position of winter and summer, and in the fall it’s in between the position of summer and winter.\n This means that in the summer the angle of the Sun is much higher, which means the Sun’s rays are focused on a smaller area, which makes it hotter. It’s also up for a longer time every day. During the winter the angle to the horizon is lower, which means the Sun’s rays are spread out over a larger area, which makes it cooler. And the days are shorter.\n Of course it’s the opposite situation for the southern hemisphere. When we have winter they have summer and so on:\n"

    "question": "What are some hobbies that will heal an INFJ?",
    "answer": "Here are a few hobbies that might heal an INFJ :\nWriting - Most of the times, writing becomes convenient because INFJs think it’s easier to pen down their thoughts rather than express it to other people - especially because INFJs feel misunderstood. It gets heavy when they’re not expressing, so writing is an excellent way to find relief. INFJs also have a way with words.Daydreaming - They have a whole world created in their heads. The satisfaction they feel after a good daydream isn’t explainable. There’s a huge sense of satisfaction, positivity and energy cleansing.Spending time in nature - INFJs connect with nature. It brings similar results to daydreaming. They usually see both plants and animals as being equal to them. INFJs sense the energies that animals or plants carry. Mostly it’s good. It makes their healing and aura cleansing process easier.Meditation - INFJs cannot compromise when it comes to their alone time. It’s there for a reason. They need to make sure that they are in “in touch” with themselves. That’s why meditation is important. It’s a means to wipe off their dust and keep themselves clean.Music - It helps them feel calm within themselves. Even if it’s depressing music, perhaps INFJs need to feel a sense of calmness inside. Music does the thing. It helps INFJs face their emotions and deal with them.Reading - Reading helps INFJ realize things. They experience the book and go through what the writer goes through - like most readers do. New lessons are often useful for them when it comes to dealing with different aspects of life.Gardening - Most INFJs feel their connection with Earth and its elements since day one. Thus gardening is important. Although the process is messy, it creates a great deal of satisfaction and happiness for an INFJ. It’s also a way to cleanse energy.Drawing, painting etc - Like writing, this is also a way INFJs can express themselves freely without feeling like they’ll be misunderstood. INFJs put all of their feelings in the making of art and find themselves feeling better.Traveling - Go for a walk. Take your car and watch the beautiful sunset. Go to another city and roam around for a week. INFJs like to observe and experience. For them, it’s like understanding the world they live in. In an INFJ’s heart, traveling isn’t vague. It includes a lot of learning.Deep conversations - INFJs know that they’re not going to feel understood no matter how hard they try. But having in depth conversations about life - with close people - will definitely please an INFJ to a certain extent. Although it won’t practically heal them, it will make them feel good. They may find the strength to go ahead with their “healing” after having these conversations.\nThanks for the A2A [LINKED_TEXT: Tamela Adams] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Tamela-Adams-6]\n"

    "answer": "It can be attributed to many factors but mostly it has to be the leadership group and team management.\nBefore the world cup the talk was all about intent,going out there and expressing themselves, especially by Rohit Sharma. But we all can see how we played our powerplay in every matches. In fact we had the worst powerplay run rate among every team present in the Super 12 stage.Secondly the batsman will win you matches but the bowlers win you tournaments and Indian bowling was not potent enough on the flat pitch and square boundaries of Adelaide.The Indian players also lacked the mindset to win such knockout games. You can see with the way Bhuvi started his over bowling wayward. The body language was not right with all the players dropping down their shoulders and going into their own shell.The coach before the world cup had Yuzi Chahal as his lead spinner playing every crucial matches and series but he was not given even a single game in this world Cup.India also badly missed Ravindra Jadeja.Axar Patel's inclusion in the semifinal was also not justified if they sent Ashwin above him for batting and when a leg spinner was needed on a turning Adelaide pitch.Now in hindsight it's easy to say that maybe KL Rahul was backed up unnecessarily and perhaps such backing was needed for Yuzi Chahal.\nThis is just the few mistakes that the Indian team keeps repeating every ICC tournaments and has become a norm.

    "answer": "Why would you would be a better question. It’s best you can’t and don’t. They don’t care. It’ll be used as ammunition. The least you communicate to a narcissist, the safer you are. They know how they treated you and it was all intentional. They meant to hurt you and when you react or tell them how it made you feel, they’ll do it more because THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE AFTER. So by telling them your feelings, you’re causing more harm. Don’t do it. So few understand what narcissism truly is. It’s a monster disguised as a human, it wears a human mask, and underneath it is missing a heart. They are incapable of feeling emotions and mimic what they’ve seen in life. Since they can’t feel real emotions, they inflict pain and abuse onto people they see as weak and their response is what they thrive off of. To a narcissist, our emotional responses are what they feed on. Much like we need oxygen to breathe, narcissists need our emotions and negative is best to them. Don’t expose yourself or bother wasting time telling a narcissist how you feel. Run.\n"

    "answer": "Oh, haha, of course not.\n For example, in Warhammer 40K, the Imperium of Man was one of the strongest galactic empires to ever exist and would have sent Palpatine and his army crying back to Coruscant.\nIn fact, even within the Star Wars Universe, there were numerous galactic empires and Sith empires that could compete with Palpatine’s own empire in power.\nMany of these ancient empires possessed superweapons as well, such as the Rakatan Infinite Empire’s legendary Star Forge - a semi-conscious floating shipyard that could automatically churn out battleships on its own. It could also boost a Force user’s connection to the Dark Side, such as when Malak went into a super-powered mode on the Star Forge and battled Revan.\nThe Eternal Empire was created by the ancient Sith (?) Lord Vitiate, later known as Valkorion, which was consisted of fleets operated by sentient droids. These ships conquered all of wild space and were practically invincible - they would likely have conquered the galaxy as well had Valkorion made up his mind to do so.\nThe most powerful empire in sci-fi would probably be the Dalek Empire, although that is debatable.

WhatsApp, on the other hand, provides end-to-end encryption for all messages and calls, ensuring better privacy.Features: Both apps offer a wide range of features such as text messaging, voice and video calls, media sharing, and group chats. However, Telegram tends to have more extensive features, including self-destructing messages, cloud-based storage, bots, channels, and more.User Base: WhatsApp has a larger user base globally, with over 2 billion monthly active users, while Telegram has over 500 million users. The user base can influence your choice based on the number of contacts you have on each platform.Cross-Platform Availability: Both apps are available on multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, and desktop. However, Telegram also offers a web version, allowing you to access your chats on any computer without the need to install additional software.Cloud Storage: Telegram provides cloud-based storage, enabling users to upload and access files from any device. WhatsApp, on the other hand, does not have the same cloud storage functionality.\nUltimately, the choice between Telegram and WhatsApp depends on your personal preferences, priorities, and the features that matter most to you. Some users prioritize security, while others focus on the availability of certain features or the size of the user base. It might be helpful to try out both apps and see which one aligns better with your needs and the preferences of your contacts.\n[LINKED_TEXT: Telegram vs WhatsApp: Which Messaging App is Right for You?Are you confused after learning about the ongoing debate between Telegram vs WhatsApp?

    "question": "Do soldiers pick up fallen enemy weapons to use if they are out of ammo on their weapons?",
    "answer": "That depends.\n If you come from a standard, NATO-type with great logistics and regular training, the best answer would be NO, since most of the time soldiers are used to train with a single small arms system. Having said that, it is not that they are utterly incapable of picking up a gun, since most of these systems are similar and simple to use. What happens is that it is mostly not recommended. If you want to increase the complexity of the situation, you have to think that some weapons might present extra challenges to the soldier that trained with one type, being it for instance CAR-15, M16, G36 or FN 2000. Those challenges include, different type of magazine location, different caliber, different adjustment of sights, ergonomics (design). Hence, using a new system in a life or death situation, it can lead to increased stress and failure.\n If you come from the marine corps, specops, special forces or any form of recon, tip of the spear, quick reaction force, chances are you will not feel that nervousness and sense of sailing in uncharted waters. The odds are in favor of your previous training, and even during basic levels you could have been familiarized with many small arms types. That includes not only handling, but also first level maintenance and disassembling, and sight adjusting (MIL-STD-1913 rail) . The philosophy “procurement on site” and “one mind any weapon” applies.\n So the answer is, you can pick up whatever you want as long as you are trained and confident to do so.\n"

The debt-to-income ratio should be lower or equal to 36%. Every debt-to-income percentage of more than 43% is regarded as excessiveAsset bubbles:An asset bubble arises whenever the value of a particular asset, including such shares, securities, property investment, or commodities, increases rapidly with no economic fundamentals to explain the price hike, like rapidly expanding demand.Too much inflation: Inflation expectations encourage conserving since they diminish the buying power of savings. This possibility can entice users to purchase and companies to develop. As a consequence, as inflation increases, unemployment frequently falls at first.Too much deflation: Deflation indicates a declining economy. Economists are concerned about deflation since dropping costs result in lower consumer expenditure, which is a key aspect of economic development.Technological change: is an improvement in a product's or system's performance which leads to an increase in output without the need for a corresponding increase in input.To know more about it check out the complete blog\n[LINKED_TEXT: Recession : What is it & How it can impact your Finances | Finanshels ResourcesA recession is defined as a significant, widespread, and long-term decline in economic activity.

    "answer": "It is a complex issue with no easy answer. There are a number of factors to consider, such as the severity of our disagreement, the former president's actions in office, and our own personal beliefs about respect.\n Some people believe that it is always important to be respectful of former presidents, regardless of our political differences. They argue that former presidents have served their country and deserve our respect, even if we disagree with their policies. Others believe that it is okay to be disrespectful to former presidents if we have strong disagreements with their policies or actions in office. They argue that former presidents are not above criticism and that we should not be afraid to speak out against them if we believe they have done something wrong.\n In the case of US District Judge Moxila Upadhyaya, she referred to Donald Trump as \"Mr. Trump\" and not \"Mr. President\". This was a deliberate decision on her part, as she was making a statement about her disagreement with Trump's policies and actions. Some people have criticized her for this, arguing that it was disrespectful to the office of the presidency. Others have defended her, arguing that she was simply exercising her right to free speech.\n Here are some additional things to consider when deciding whether or not to be respectful to a former president:\nThe severity of our disagreement: If we disagree with a former president on a minor issue, it may be less important to be respectful than if we disagree on a major issue.The former president's actions in office: If a former president has committed serious crimes or abuses of power, it may be more difficult to be respectful of them.Our own personal beliefs about respect: Some people believe that it is always important to be respectful of others, regardless of their actions. Others believe that respect is earned and can be lost.\nIt is also important to remember that respect is a two-way street. If we want to be respected by former presidents, we should also be respectful of them. This means listening to their views, even if we disagree with them, and avoiding personal attacks.\n"

No one on The Rolling Stones get that kind of recognition. Mick Taylor was a better guitarist then Townshend but the same can’t be said for Jones, Wood, or Richards. Pete Townshend is one of the best song writers in rock history. Jagger and Richards Are also very good. The big difference is, Townshend wrote songs towards a theme for the album. Even when it wasn’t a rock opera. The Rolling Stones were often more about the individual songs. The story goes that The Rolling Stones didn’t release their Rock and Roll Circus because The Who showed them up. At this time the Stones were being considered one of the rock ‘n’ roll great and the who were up-and-coming; Tommy hadn’t come out yet.\n The Rolling Stones couldn’t hold a candle to The Who live but few bands would dare.

    "question": "How can you stop a car if someone cuts the brakes?",
    "answer": "Every driver should know whether or not they have anti-lock brakes or regular brakes. If you have a logo that lights up whenever you start your car that says ABS then you have anti-lock brakes, if not, you have regular brakes.\n If your brakes go out, you want to do three things. First, down-shift to a lower gear. Second, if you have regular brakes pump the brake pedal fast and hard to build up brake fluid pressure. If the brakes haven’t started working after three or four pumps go on the step three which is use the parking brake. Gradually apply the parking brake and be prepared for the car to skid.\n If none of the brakes work, put the car into a low gear and steer in a safe direction until the car completely rolls to a stop. Don’t turn the steering wheel too much but just enough to avoid obstacles. If you’re at highway speeds it may be advisable to scrap your car against the guard rail or divider using the friction to slow the car down. If you do this, come in at a shallow angle and gently rub the car against it. In order to warn other drivers that your brakes are out you can honk your horn and flash your lights\n If you have anti-lock brakes, you should practice sudden stops on both dry and wet pavement in a safe off street situation. When using anti-lock brakes the rule of thumb is to press the pedal all the way to the floor. You will feel a strong vibration in the pedal which is a sign that the ABS is working properly.\n"

    "question": "Did the post office create zip codes?",
    "answer": "Did the post office create zip codes?\n In the 60’s the Zone Improvement Plan (ZIP) was implemented. The first digit divides the country into 10 geographic areas. Zero starts in New England and nine covers the West coast. Within these areas certain locations were chosen to be the Sectional Center Facilities (SCF’s), and each received a two digit number. So the first 3 numbers of your ZIP code is your SCF and identifies the local facility that serves as the distribution center for all your mail.\n The last two numbers will identify the Zone around your SCF. This is usually a branch of the main facility, if you are in a suburb, or a local Post Office if you are in a town.\n In the 80’s the ZIP code was expanded to ZIP+4. This adds a 4 digit number that represents two more pieces of information called the Sector and Segment. These numbers can be used to pinpoint directly to your mailbox. However, you would need access to computerized Sort Plan to make that correlation.\n Note: It is not necessary for you to remember your ZIP+4. If it is not there the sorting equipment will add it for you in the form of a barcode.\n"

    "question": "What type of refrigerants are used in the marine industry?",
    "answer": "By far the best refrigerants for both performance and value for money, are R22 and R12. However the Montreal Protocol scuppered these excellent gases in favour of low GHG and other polar bear saving types.\n R134a - Long-term replacement for R-12. Best performance in medium and high temperature applications (air conditioning).\n R407C - Best performance in medium and high temperature applications. Suitable for new systems and R-22 changeover (air conditioning).\n R404A - Best performance in low and medium temperature applications. Common in new marine systems. Provision refrigeration.\n R507 - Best performance in low and medium temperature applications. Common in new systems. Provision refrigeration.\n All good stuff, eh? Lots of polar bears willing to shake your hand…\n Trouble is, it costs more to make these new gases compared to R12 and R22, so they are more expensive. Talking to marine engineers still at sea, they are often short of gas in their provision and air conditioning systems because the owner won’t buy them. R12 and R22 were cheap as chips and you could have as much as you wanted.\n Besides costing more to make and therefore buy (DuPont must have financed the Montreal Protocol?), the compressors and other equipment are often more robust and therefore consume more CO2 to make than the 12/22 systems, so adding to GHG. More power is required, so they add to the CO2 by virtue of more powerful electric motor drives\n They are blended gases. That’s fine until you have a leak (all refrigeration systems leak) though the lighter fractions will leak off first, leaving an inefficient half-blend behind to the detriment of your cooling capacity. You can’t “top them up” with new blended gas as the resultant mixture will still be below par, so you have to pump the charge down to cylinders for discharge ashore. More expense again, with the shipowner not caring whether you are hot in your cabin or your food’s going rotten in the fridge rooms.\n Sold a pup!\n for other transfer gases, see [LINKED_TEXT: https://www.wilhelmsen.com/globalassets/marine-products/refrigeration-solutions/documents/unicool-brochure_061110_lowres.pdf] [URL: https://www.wilhelmsen.com/globalassets/marine-products/refrigeration-solutions/documents/unicool-brochure_061110_lowres.pdf]\n"

    "answer": "Indeed, even before machine code was programming without the code in memory. This was done by patch cables connecting the units together in the right order.\n[LINKED_TEXT: Programming the ENIACProgramming the ENIAChttp://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/eniac.html] [URL: http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/eniac.html]The idea of stored program computer is credited to John von Neumann, but really is present in the idea of Universal Turing Machine. von Neumann had worked with Turing.\n Then machine instructions keyed or toggled in. But these were rather fixed with fixed addresses.\n Assemblers meant symbolic locations could be used with the assembler resolving these. Linkers and loaders could relocate code by changing addresses.\n Then that was not really needed when absolute addresses transformed to relative addresses and offsets in a stack or allocated blocks.\n So far we have had several steps abstracting from hardware (names are an abstraction, since a name denotes a more complex concept underneath that is cumbersome to work with).\n Note that abstraction results in flexibility and independence.\n Now for the most spectacular and liberating idea in computing. Programs are not about the machine they run on. Computations are independent of computer.\n That is why high-level languages were developed — originally to solve the problem of vendors changing instruction sets with every new machine (somewhat resolved with Burroughs B5000 and IBM 360, both still around!, then Intel, oh well).\n Languages define their own computational model independent of machines. Like the early assemblers translating symbols to addresses, source languages are also translated to machine code.\n When people learn about low-level coding, and even machine code, it should not be about ‘learning how things really work’, it should be about understanding the above evolution of abstraction.\n Students of computer science need to realise that CS is in this forward direction towards abstraction not in the backwards direction towards the machine.\n As many have said they have got to where they are by standing on the shoulders of giants. In computing, this is not just the layered nature of systems, but the giants who have had to insight to raise programming to the next level of abstraction.\n[LINKED_TEXT: 'Standing on the shoulders of giants' - the meaning and origin of this phraseThe meaning and origin of the phrase 'Standing on the shoulders of giants'.https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/268025.html] [URL: https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/268025.html]"

    "question": "Which is better for a TV, a Neo QLED or OLED?",
    "answer": "Both Neo QLED and OLED are advanced display technologies with their own strengths and characteristics. Here's a comparison to help you make an informed decision:\nContrast Ratio:\nOLED: OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) TVs have individually lit pixels that can turn off completely, resulting in perfect black levels and an infinite contrast ratio. This leads to excellent picture quality with deep blacks and vibrant colours.Neo QLED: Neo QLED TVs use Quantum Dot technology combined with Mini-LED backlighting. While they offer excellent contrast and black levels, they may not achieve the same absolute black levels as OLED.\nBrightness:\nOLED: OLED TVs have a lower peak brightness compared to Neo QLED. Although they deliver excellent picture quality in darker environments, they may not be as bright in well-lit rooms or for HDR content.Neo QLED: Neo QLED TVs offer higher peak brightness levels, making them better suited for brighter rooms and HDR content, where highlights can be more vibrant.\nViewing Angle:\nOLED: OLED panels have wide viewing angles, ensuring consistent picture quality from various angles. This makes OLED TVs ideal for large rooms or situations where multiple viewers are watching from different positions.Neo QLED: While Neo QLED TVs have improved viewing angles compared to traditional LCD panels, they may not match the wide viewing angles of OLED.\nBurn-in:\nOLED: OLED TVs are susceptible to burn-in, which occurs when static images are displayed for extended periods. This can result in permanent image retention. However, modern OLED TVs have implemented various measures to mitigate this issue, such as pixel shifting and screen savers.Neo QLED: Neo QLED TVs do not suffer from burn-in issues.\nGaming and Fast Motion:\nOLED: OLED TVs offer exceptional response times and are well-suited for gaming and fast-motion content, as they can display rapid movements with minimal blur.Neo QLED: Neo QLED TVs also provide excellent response times, making them suitable for gaming and fast-action scenes.\nIn summary, if you prioritize perfect black levels, infinite contrast ratio, and wide viewing angles, OLED may be the better choice for you. On the other hand, if you value higher peak brightness, vibrant HDR performance, and reduced risk of burn-in, Neo QLED could be a more suitable option.\n Considering Pristine Services can help you further by understanding your specific requirements and recommending the best TV based on your preferences, budget, and the available options in their inventory.\n For more information visit - 8408817300\n Contact\n us - 8408817300\n"

    "answer": "According to Mohammad Hatta, Indonesia's first vice president and one of two proclamators of Indonesian independence, later also acting as prime minister:\n \nIndonesia has no territorial claims whatsoever beyond the area of the former Netherlands Indies. From the very beginning Indonesian nationalism was not determined by identical origin, identical language or identical religion, but had its basis in the realization of various component parts that they formed one entity with a common destiny and purpose. Under Dutch colonial domination, which lasted for more than 300 years, the different ethnic groups in the former Netherlands Indies became aware of sharing the same destiny. It is this phenomenon that provided the base for Indonesian nationalism and thereby defined the territorial limits of the present free and unified Republic of Indonesia.\nSource: \"One Indonesian View of the Malaysia Issue\", Mohammad Hatta ([LINKED_TEXT: http://www.jstor.org/stable/2642403?seq=1] [URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/2642403?seq=1])\n"

    "answer": "To echo a couple of other answers: Keep the current trees!\n The smells of those particular cats on those particular cat trees will help them to settle into the new environment. Also try to place them in a configuration that seems familiar; if they were near eachother, place them near eachother. If there was a table nearby, place the table nearby.\n Also try to provide new spots for the cats to adjust to. Maybe put a few hand towels where they normally sit in the cat trees, to get their scent on them, then place them around on other furniture in the new place after a week or so. This can help them navigate the social landscape regarding “good spots” to sit.\n Remember that cats are very territorial animals, and if you take away their familiar markers they will feel like they are in territory that is not their own. If you take their primary comfort objects, like their cat trees, and place them in their new space, they will understand that the cat trees mark their territory and this will make them more comfortable in the new space.\n And get new cat trees. Maybe after a few hours or days or weeks, they’ll accept the new ones, and you can get rid of the old ones with all of their scents and memories.\n"

    "question": "What is an SME IPO? What are its annual revenues?",
    "answer": "An SME IPO is an initial public offering (IPO) of equity shares in a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME). These IPOs are designed specifically for SMEs to raise capital and expand their business operations. The annual revenues of an SME can vary widely depending on the sector and the size of the company, but typically, SMEs have annual revenues between Rs. 10 crore to Rs. 500 crore.\n To be eligible for an SME IPO, a company must have a post-issue paid-up capital of less than Rs. 25 crore and a net worth of less than Rs. 100 crore. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has set up a separate platform for SME IPOs, called the SME Exchange. This platform provides SMEs with easier access to capital markets and allows them to raise funds through equity financing.\n SME IPOs are a good option for SMEs that are looking to expand their business operations or require capital for growth. By going public, SMEs can access a larger pool of investors, which can help them raise more capital and increase their brand visibility. However, going public also requires SMEs to comply with various regulatory requirements and disclose financial information to the public, which can be time-consuming and costly.\n"

    "answer": "Explaining a medical condition like type 1 diabetes to children can be challenging, but it's important to provide them with information that is accurate, easy to understand, and non-scary. Here are some tips to help explain type 1 diabetes to children:\nUse age-appropriate language: Use simple language and avoid using medical jargon that children may not understand. You can use examples they can relate to, such as comparing insulin to a key that unlocks a door to let sugar into the cells.Focus on the facts: Explain that type 1 diabetes is a medical condition where the body cannot make enough insulin, which is a hormone that helps the body turn food into energy. Explain that people with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin through injections or an insulin pump to keep their blood sugar levels in the right range.Emphasize that it's not their fault: It's important to emphasize to children that type 1 diabetes is not caused by anything they did or did not do, and it's not something that they can catch from someone else.Highlight the positive aspects: Explain that people with type 1 diabetes can still do all the things they enjoy, but they need to take care of themselves by eating healthy foods, exercising, and taking their insulin as directed.Address their concerns: Children may have concerns or fears about their own health or the health of someone they love with type 1 diabetes. Address their concerns honestly and reassure them that with proper care and management, people with type 1 diabetes can lead happy, healthy lives.\nOverall, it's important to keep the conversation positive and reassuring, and to answer any questions the child may have in an honest and age-appropriate way.\n"

Each has its own perks that may or may not be useful for your business or research objectives.\n A review of which one is better should take into account what you need to accomplish with your surveys, as well as some specific features that each offers.\n Let's give you a quick breakdown of each.\n SurveyMonkey is more than just online survey software - it is one of the best and most respected providers of:\n Web-based email, collaboration and marketing tools\n They also provide forms and surveys as their main product, but on top of that they offer:\n MailChimp for managing email lists and campaigns\n Zendesk, a help desk software tool for customer service\n Crashlytics, an app development platform\n Trello , a project management tool (which can also be used to manage user feedback)\n Producteev - collaborative task management software.\n What is unique about SurveyMonkey?\n In addition to being a good overall survey tool, SurveyMonkey also provides so many other products and features that your business can use.\n Some of these include:\n A/B testing tools - for split-testing email subject lines, etc.\n Data import tools - which you can use to grab contact information from, say MailChimp or Salesforce.\n Analytics for your surveys - allowing you to track completion times, etc.\n An easy way to set up a customer support chat box on your site\n A survey builder tool - allowing you to build questions without having any programming knowledge.\n Create an email list - based on survey responses\n SurveyMonkey has a free option, but it is limited. To get the most out of their features you should upgrade to one of their business plans which starts at about $35/month.\n SoGoSurvey , however, offers just what you'd expect from online survey software: A way to create surveys and collect responses.\n What is unique about SoGoSurvey?\n SoGoSurvey offers more language options for their survey questions, including Spanish, French, Italian, German, simplified Chinese and Portuguese. They also have a wider range of question types - particularly in the form design section. You can ask multiple-choice questions with up to six answer options for example.\n They have a very flexible survey feature, allowing you to create link-based surveys, pop-up surveys and even embedded surveys. They also offer an offline mode - so if you are surveying someone who is not connected to the internet at the time (say they're on a plane) , they can still complete the survey once they're back online.\n With SoGoSurvey you can also embed your surveys on other webpages, as well as download a CSV report of your results.\n SoGoSurvey offers a free plan with some limited features, but their paid plans start at about $25/month.\n"

    "answer": "All the time. Truth is, that actors-producers ofthen purchase rights (and thus a lead role) for the specific book or screenplays. It’s not even a 1’st tire actors and actresses. It’s like they’re demigods. The actor who wrote good screenplay have much lesser creative power (however, Matt Damon/Ben Afflec made break-through with their “Good Will Hunting”, but this is exception).\n Then there going the 1’st tier stars. They’re media dolls, on the summit of popularity and everybody and their dog know them. Their name attached to the movie, is like invisible $100 mln. cheque, that makes financiers trow the money on table as if mesmerized. Daily and nightly producers try to win 5 minutes of their time to present the ideal for them role. But.. they receive 80% of the roles they want. On their terms off course.\n After them, there’s the 2′nd tier stars. Everybody know them, but they’re not really a sensation. Those are often better, than 1’st tier, at acting as they constantly strive to the top or already have felt from there, making them desperately want back there. They would work double hard, they would carry the movie, but they would get around 40%–60% of the roles they want. They’re huge asset, but the top stars’ agent would make everything to not let them to outshine their clients. But the movies under $30 millions are their.\n And there’s the rest.\n Morale: every actor/actress participate in auditions.\n It’s a part of their job. They should be cross tested with their future partners (yes, that’s the “chemistry” we talk about), are they believable together (or alone) and do they fit the role at all? To answer that, you’ll need to see them. Sometimes to compare. If that’s not convincing, read trivia to the movies. Yes, some of the names considered for the role are only rumours and real actors newer knew that some director thought of them as a candidate for a role. But others tried their best. And their best is another movie, so they went there.\n"

    "question": "What would happen if we could use 100% of our brain?",
    "answer": "There hasn't been sufficient proof and knowledge to figure out how much of our brain is being used and that 10 % or less theory is definitely bluff. Our brains have significantly evolved since that theory was proposed. Trying to determine how much of our brain is being used, by using the same brain of ours would be the trickiest thing to do, if at all possible, by the means developed by the same brain.\n And since time immemorial, from being a single cell organism to this present human state, our brain has evolved by leaps and bounds. So, how can we say that we are only using a certain percentage of our brain when there is compound annual growth happening in our brain, year on year.\n Morever, human body is a complex mechanism, far complicated than a supercomputer, so any CPU managing it can't be underestimated. It is working 24/7 to maintain our body, adapting continously to random things for our preservation and catering to our mental nuisances.\n It may be possible that one individual may be using half the brain than other, but overall, we are using good amount of it definitely. In fact, during our evolution, the capacity of our brain might have grown more than 100 or 1000 %, if someone could only use his brain to measure it somehow 😀\n"

    "question": "What is the difference between \"perfume\", \"eau de toilette\" and \"cologne\"?",
    "answer": "As noted, above, the terms \"perfume\" and \"cologne\" can indicate the concentration ratio of the perfume's essence oils, to the amount of alcohol it has been diluted with. The purest form of popular fragrances, sold in department stores/etc. is usually labeled as \"Parfum\" and will usually be the most expensive item in that fragrance line, as it is also the highest concentration of essence oils and is the least diluted, with alcohol. This is why most of these bottles are not sprays. It is true, that these are too strong, for spray, and also that it is possible, that with it being less diluted, they could possibly become more difficult to spray/create more possibilities that the sprayer clogs/works improperly by letting out too little or too much of the product, and therefore, making for a possible waste of money.\n Also, a common trend, when talking about \"perfume\" and \"cologne,\" exists in that many associate \"perfume\" with women's fragrances and \"cologne\" with men's fragrances, when actually, some men's fragrances do come as an \"eau de parfum,\" though not as many. They are also not as lowly concentrated as cologne, after shave or \"eau de cologne,\" but their classification is usually \"eau de toilette\" which has a concentration ratio of essence oils, to alcohol, as that less than an \"eau de parfum\" but greater than an after shave or an \"eau de cologne\" (Both of which are actually additional class levels). The end-ranking is just Cologne, and as mentioned, before, this is typical for splashes and body sprays. \n Hope this helps!\n"

    "question": "Do autopilot systems in some way diminish the natural skills and reflexes of pilots?",
    "answer": "If the question is, should we stop using them, the answer is an emphatic no. Of course not. They do make flying much safer. When they work.\n Having the finest autopilot in the world is not an excuse not to practice basic piloting skills, either in a simulator or in real life. Every pilot should be able to land their plane without an auto pilot. Period.\n The classic recent crash that demonstrated the importance of basic flying skills is the Asiana Airline Flight 214 crash at San Francisco International. (2013)\n Weather was perfect. Wind was calm. The plane was operating in VFR (Visual Flight Rules) conditions, requiring the pilot land the plane visually. It is common practice in such circumstances to use the auto pilot approach system anyway and let the plane do the work. On this fateful day, the Instrument Landing System (ILS) was out-of-service for the runway in use. This means that the pilot had to actually land the plane!\n In the end, the pilot did not have the skills necessary to land the plane manually. It went too low on approach, collided with a sea wall, causing a crash. It was incredibly lucky that only one or two people died and apparently, they were not in their seat belts and were ejected.\n These were not US pilots and did not have a US pilots license. However, it is not the autopilot to blame, but the airlines training and the county of origin for the pilots training requirements to blame. You have to know how to fly your airplane or you should not be piloting it.\n"

    "question": "How much longer can the Russian economy sustain its war with Ukraine?",
    "answer": "However, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is a complex issue that involves various economic, political, and military factors.\n It is worth noting that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is not solely an economic issue, and the sustainability of the Russian economy is affected by various internal and external factors. The Russian economy has been facing challenges, including declining oil prices, economic sanctions, and structural issues, which have led to a decline in economic growth and a decrease in living standards for some Russian citizens.\n In terms of the impact of the conflict on the Russian economy, the sanctions imposed by Western countries have affected certain sectors of the economy, such as finance, energy, and defense. These sanctions have limited the ability of Russian companies to access global financial markets, which has constrained investment and economic growth. However, the Russian government has sought to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on oil and gas exports, which may help mitigate the impact of the sanctions.\n In terms of the impact of the conflict on Ukraine, the ongoing hostilities have had a severe impact on the Ukrainian economy, including the loss of territory and damage to infrastructure. Ukraine has also faced challenges in securing access to gas supplies, which has led to energy shortages and higher prices for consumers.\n In conclusion, the sustainability of the Russian economy in the context of the conflict with Ukraine is a complex issue that depends on various factors. While economic sanctions have affected the Russian economy, the conflict is not solely an economic issue and involves various political and military factors. The impact of the conflict on Ukraine has been severe, with significant economic and humanitarian consequences.\n"

    "question": "How does the sound processor process sound? What actions does it perform to do that?",
    "answer": "A sound processor, also known as a digital signal processor (DSP), performs several actions to process sound:\nSampling: The sound processor first samples the analog sound signal at regular intervals to convert it into a digital signal. This process is called digitization.Filtering: The sound processor then filters the digital signal to remove unwanted noise and other interference. Different types of filters can be applied, such as low-pass filters, high-pass filters, and band-pass filters.Amplification: The sound processor may then adjust the gain or volume of the digital signal.Equalization: The sound processor can then apply equalization to adjust the balance of the different frequencies in the signal.Compression: The sound processor can also apply compression to control the dynamic range of the signal and prevent clipping or distortion.Time and pitch manipulation: The sound processor can also perform time-based processing, such as time-stretching and pitch-shifting, to modify the tempo and pitch of the sound.Signal routing: The sound processor can route the processed signal to different outputs, such as speakers or headphones.\nThese are some of the common actions performed by a sound processor. The exact processing performed depends on the specific sound processor and its intended use.\n"

    "question": "My blood pressure was 138/83 and my pulse was 52. Is this borderline high?",
    "answer": "Your blood pressure reading of 138/83 mmHg falls within the category of elevated blood pressure. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and consists of two values: the systolic pressure (the higher number) and the diastolic pressure (the lower number).\n In your reading:\n - The systolic pressure is 138 mmHg, which represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart contracts.\n - The diastolic pressure is 83 mmHg, which represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart is at rest between beats.\n Elevated blood pressure is defined as a systolic pressure between 120 and 129 mmHg and a diastolic pressure below 80 mmHg. Your diastolic pressure of 83 mmHg falls within the normal range, but the systolic pressure is slightly elevated.\n A pulse rate of 52 beats per minute (bpm) is generally considered normal for most adults, especially if you are at rest and feeling well.\n While your blood pressure is not classified as high, it is essential to monitor it regularly, as elevated blood pressure can be a risk factor for developing hypertension (high blood pressure) in the future. Lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining a balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity, managing stress, and avoiding tobacco use, can help support overall cardiovascular health and help keep blood pressure within a healthy range.\n If you have any concerns about your blood pressure or overall health, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and guidance. They can assess your individual health status, provide recommendations, and monitor your blood pressure over time.\n"

    "question": "If Deku catches Goku off guard, can he one-shot him?",
    "answer": "In all likelihood, yes. However, the reality of the situation is that it’s harder than it sounds to catch Goku ‘off-guard’. Due to Goku’s sheer speed and reaction time and his instinctive combat abilities, Deku would have to be standing next to Goku and someone that Goku already assessed is completely non-hostile for Deku to have a chance at pulling this off.\n We have two instances of this working on Goku in canon:\n 1- Krillin, Goku’s lifelong friend, suddenly surprise attacked him by throwing a rock at him without warning. No hostile intent was involved, this was actually a playful action.\n 2 - Frieza’s soldier fired a raygun while Goku was distracted speaking to Frieza. The shot from the gun likely moves at the speed of light.\n Deku cannot move at a speed fast enough to emulate 2, and he is not Goku’s childhood friend like Krillin was. He also would radiate hostile or even killing intent in his wind up and attack.\n So the answer is yes in theory, but it’s probably not going to happen.\n"

    "question": "If you agree with Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan that its time to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security because the deficit has skyrocketed, what percentage of cut to each program would you support?",
    "answer": "Social Security has a simple problem: it was designed during a time when it was expected the labor force would increase pretty much in a linear manner forever. This was at a time when a medium-size factory employed 4,000 people. It was inconceivable that the nation’s economy would do anything different.\n Today, we have 1 worker contributing to pay two retirees, if not more. It isn’t working as designed and will never work that way again. We will not see a massive increase in the labor force where there are two workers for each retiree even after the last Baby Boomer dies.\n So we have to do something about that. The only thing that makes sense is to have people with their own, dedicated account. You pay in, you collect what you paid in plus interest. How we convert from what we have now to that will likely be very, very expensive but there really is no choice. Unless you are convinced we are going to return to robotless factories with thousands of workers all over the country.\n Medicare is a big problem as far as costs, but it will come down as the Baby Boomers die off. Realistically, we just need to make sure that happens sooner rather than later. Old people die, there is no changing that. But we can get them to die at 70 rather than 90 and this will make the program far easier to finance.\n Medicaid is a joke. With Obamacare, it is a program that is supposed to make up for the fact that people can’t afford insurance without a white-collar job. The expansion was a mistake and we have to eliminate it. So it returns to a program for the unemployed, welfare recipient. The problem with Medicaid as a whole is that statistically the outcome for your Medicaid patient is the same as no treatment at all. -it isn’t helping. It is a placebo that takes the place of health care. This needs to be corrected at all costs - there is no reason for a program that has no effect to be in existence.\n Shrinking Medicaid back to the original bounds, eliminating the last vestiges of Obamacare and allowing young people to have things like catastrophic care insurance once again would be a good first step.\n Starting from the idea of shrinking Medicare is a non-starter - you have to get the people to die first. Then the program shrinks itself.\n Can the US recover from its entitlement spending spree? Maybe. But it is going to be very unpleasant. We have millions of people on pension programs that will be bankrupt soon, if not that way already.\n Could we tax our way out of this? Unlikely. The people with money in the US are tax-averse. They will do anything to avoid paying taxes, including holding money overseas. When you clamp down on people to try to get them to pay more, they will renounce US citizenship to keep the IRS hands off their money. If we raised tax rates to 70%, the tax revenue would likely remain about the same because of this.\n"

    "question": "How could you classify multiple objects in a single image in TensorFlow?",
    "answer": "There are several ways to classify multiple objects in a single image using TensorFlow. Here are three approaches:\nObject Detection: Object detection is a popular approach for identifying and localizing multiple objects in an image. Object detection models like Faster R-CNN, YOLO, and SSD are trained to classify objects and locate them in an image. These models work by dividing the image into a grid of cells and predicting the presence of objects in each cell, along with their bounding boxes.Instance Segmentation: Instance segmentation is another approach that involves identifying each object in an image and creating a pixel-level mask for each object. Models like Mask R-CNN are trained to classify objects and create a mask for each instance of an object in the image.Multiple Class Classification: If the objects in the image are non-overlapping and you just need to classify each object into a specific category, you can use a multi-class classification model. You can train a deep learning model to classify each object in the image into a specific category. One approach is to crop each object from the image and train a classifier on each object individually.\nIn TensorFlow, you can use pre-trained models or train your own models using the TensorFlow Object Detection API, TensorFlow Hub, or the Keras API.\n"

    "question": "I want to start a diet but I can never go by the diet. I always eat more. How can I keep going along with my diet?",
    "answer": "Most diets are designed to lose weight over the short term and have a focus on weight and not holistic health—as in nutrition and disease prevention/healing through whole plant foods. Consequently, most diets use caloric restriction and just eating less of the food that naturally leads to weight gain. Which will lead your body craving and needing more.\n Now, a caloric deficit is necessary to lose weight. Yet one can and ideally achieves this through actually eating more!\nThe key to losing weight isn’t eating less, but actually eating MORE of the right foods.\n vegetarians, especially vegans, have consistently shown to have lower and normal BMI’s compared to omnivores or pescatarians for the main reason that they eat more fruits and vegetables which are naturally low in calories.\n By eating more fruits and vegetables you can eat more, fill up your stomach, and satisfy your hunger and nutritional needs, while still reaching your weight goals.\n a clear strategy can give us our best results. But diets often fail because they are meant to.\nWhen trying to maintain our weight it is best to approach it from an education and holistic health mindset then trying to punish ourselves just to lose a few pounds at any consequence.\n This is all of course easier said than done.\n Knowing that we should do something is NOT that same as understanding why we should do it or how to do it. But those answers are only for those who are willing to help themselves by asking for help and to Eat the Forbidden Fruit 🍎\n"

    "question": "Is IQ a good measurement of one’s intelligence?",
    "answer": "IQ (Intelligence Quotient) is one measure of intelligence, but it is not a perfect measure and has limitations. IQ tests typically measure cognitive abilities such as reasoning, memory, and processing speed, and provide a numerical score that is intended to reflect an individual's intellectual potential or ability. However, it is important to recognize that intelligence is a complex and multifaceted construct that cannot be fully captured by a single score on a test.\n There are several limitations of IQ tests that can impact their validity and accuracy. For example:\nCultural bias: Some IQ tests have cultural biases that can affect the scores of individuals from certain ethnic or socioeconomic backgrounds. This can lead to inaccurate or unfair assessments of intelligence.Limited scope: IQ tests typically focus on cognitive abilities such as math, language, and spatial reasoning, and may not fully capture other types of intelligence, such as emotional or social intelligence.Environmental factors: IQ tests measure an individual's potential for intelligence, but factors such as upbringing, education, and environment can also impact the development and expression of intelligence.Test-taking skills: IQ tests require specific skills such as time management, test-taking strategies, and familiarity with the format of the test. Individuals who lack these skills may perform poorly on IQ tests, even if they possess high levels of intelligence.\nIn conclusion, while IQ tests can provide a measure of intelligence, they have limitations that should be considered. It is important to use multiple measures of intelligence and to take into account environmental and cultural factors when assessing someone's intellectual abilities\n for more detail visit our channel.\n link is given below\n"

    "question": "Would a random number generator be more or less random than me just randomly saying numbers? Why or why not?",
    "answer": "Most people have a very skewed view of what makes a sequence random.\n For instance most people think that in a random sequence numbers rarely repeat (where as if you are picking 5 numbers from 10 possibles, the sequence 1,1,1,1,1 is just as likely as any other sequence of 5 numbers).\n Also people tend when given a large range to choose from, will choose a sequences that exhibits some level of clustering.\n People also have favorite numbers that they will pick, and also have numbers that they avoid.\n A pseudo-random number generator will use an algorithm that is specifically chosen so as to match the key criteria of random numbers :\neach value is equally likely regardless of preceding valuesEvery sub-sequence of n values is just as likely to occur as every other sequence of n values - although most PRNG are fixed with and therefore there is a practical limit to how large n is before this measure stops being true.\nIn general for most PRNGs - since they are based on a known set of operations, if you know the starting state you can predict the sequence of generated values; so they aren’t truly random - but normally the starting state is designed to be difficult to know (maybe the exact time including milliseconds). In general attempting to derive the starting state from the sequence of numbers is also impractical.\n"

    "answer": "Assembly is a language that mnemonically translate directly instruction by instruction to machine language code.\n The final code run as information stored in a proportionally slow memory (RAM) and retrieved by the CPU in chunks that goes to the CPU’s cache and the CPU executes in sequence or by branching with jump instructions. Compiled code might balance this RAM/cache timing well and automatically. Assembly code is not bounded by any automation/simplification, it has a greater degree of freedom, so it permits to tune to the maximum the performance, it might not be easy.\n There is always an assembly code equivalent to the compiled code (it’s even easy to produce the assembly code from the high leve code using some option when invoking the compiler), but in assembly is possible to write sequence of instructions that the compiler wouldn’t consider to generate, however consider that there is some work in the compiler about aspects specific to the target CPU/architecture that should be considered too to compete while writing code in assembly\n"

That refinery is already getting the oil it needs from a new pipeline already in service.\n Two. The oil from the Keystone pipeline is not for domestic use, it is for export via Houston. This has NO EFFECT on America’s energy independence.\n Three. The company behind the Keystone pipeline has a history of running its pipelines right through the middle of Indian lands by force. This particular pipeline is contained within a right-of-way, essentially a land grant of Indian lands, and runs beneath the water reservoir upon which the Reservation depends for its water. The oil carried by the pipeline is toxic and dense (little more than asphalt), so if the pipeline leaks, the oil will sink unseen to the bottom of the reservoir, thereby invisibly poisoning the reservoir. It could have easily been sited differently, but wasn’t, so this is a feature, not a bug.\n If you are a capitalist, you should support ending the Keystone XL pipeline.\nIt takes Indian lands from the control of the owner for the sole benefit of an international corporation, without compensation. That is inconsistent with capitalism, and is consistent with socialism.\nIf you support self-determination, you should support ending the Keystone XL pipeline.\nThe owners of that land should have the right to decline to have the pipeline, an existential threat, be routed under the reservoir when better, more accessible, and less risky alternative routes exist.\nIf you support the Constitution’s First Amendment, you should support ending the Keystone XL pipeline.\nThe GOP tried to pass a bill banning protests over infrastructure projects, making protesting illegal.\nIf you support American freedom over the rights of a Canadian company,\nEssentially all the benefits of this project go to a Canadian company.\nIf you do not support the federal government confiscating Indian lands, you should support ending the Keystone XL pipeline.\n"

You might look for a used Kenwood TS-570, A Yaesu FT-857 or FT-897, or an Icom IC-706. Antennas can also be an issue.

    "question": "What are the differences between a news anchor and an announcer?",
    "answer": "First, it’s worth noting that many announcers have become anchors; reporters, often called “correspondents,” are out at the scene of a story. Meanwhile, on a TV newscast (and on radio before that), the anchor is the person who hosts the broadcast. He or she reads the major stories, usually from the studio, and at times, tosses to a correspondent out in the field to report from the scene of a story. (Sometimes, the anchor too is out in the field, during a major crisis like the aftermath of a hurricane, for example, but usually the anchor works from the studio and the correspondents are at the scene.) Some anchors not only host and read the stories, but they go out and do some reporting too. However, that’s usually in the smaller markets. In the major markets (the biggest cities), the news anchor runs the broadcast, and works with his or her team of on-the-scene reporters.\n But if you are just talking about an announcer, that is often the person who reads commercials, or introduces a program, or does voice-over work (you see the video images, and hear someone’s voice narrating the story). An announcer may be trained in news, at which point, he or she will be reporting the stories. But every radio and TV station has both announcers and anchors. The difference is in their expertise and in the role the station needs them to play. Not every announcer handles news; they might announce any one of a number of different kinds of programs, or they might just read various types of announcements. But an anchor is generally associated with on-screen (and sometimes on-the-scene) news or sports coverage.\n"

    "question": "Is it ever too early to start a design history file ready ideation for a medical device? What about when the clinician first talks to the engineer?",
    "answer": "It’s never too early to start DHFRI. Huh? What is DHFRI?\n Let’s first start with some clarifications on what is a Design History File (DHF) for a medical device, versus Design Controls, versus Design History File Ready Ideation (DHFRI).\n Design Controls are part of a formal regulation (such as the FDA’s Quality System Regulation) and/or standard (such as ISO 13485). Established medical device companies will have a quality system in place and typically have a specific standard operating procedure (SOP) for Design Controls.\n DHF is a documentation process that captures key relationships, often called a Trace Matrix, of User Needs, Design Inputs, Design Outputs, Verification, and Validation. The DHF will also capture history of risk reduction and Human Factors Engineering formative and summative studies.\n There is most definitely a “too early” zone for Design Controls. One clear demarcation line is if you haven’t yet started a company. In this case, there’s no quality system and no SOP to be compliant to. It wouldn’t make sense to draft an SOP and/or implement such a strict quality system prior to starting a company.\n However, it’s never too early to start capturing design history, aka, the building blocks for that Trace Matrix. Even at the earliest stages of a clinician and engineer talking together about potential problems; user needs are being captured for inspiration. But are they being used to build a foundation for future Design Controls?\n The pain of turning on Design Controls pales in comparison to the pain of building a trace matrix. Capturing unmet needs and then articulating them into well defined user needs can be a fun process when embraced throughout the design process. However, when trying to articulate needs that are going back in time, potentially years of design history past; that’s painful. And that’s just one column of the matrix.\n [LINKED_TEXT: Design History File Ready Ideation (DHFRI)] [URL: https://trig.com/design-history-file-ready-ideation-guidebook] is a framework that encourages fun, iterative, and innovative design practices while assembling the foundation of future design controls.\n It’s never too early to start DHFRI.\n Health & HappinessAndrew\n"

The missile was tracked and monitored by various telemetry and radar stations and had followed textbook trajectory, meeting all mission objectives with a high level of accuracy.\nAgni Prime is the latest and most advanced variant of the Agni class of missiles. It is a canisterised missile and has a range of 2000Km. It also incorporates the cutting-edge technologies used in Agni-IV and Agni-V missiles.\nThe two-stage and solid-fuelled weapon system is guided by inertial navigation systems based on advanced ring-laser gyroscopes that have been developed in DRDO. Both stages now have composite rocket motors and guidance systems which are equipped with best in class electromechanical actuators. The best part is that Agni missiles were the best in their class in terms of accuracy, lethality, reliability and maintained friendly so now the in-corporation of this new technology would make them even more potent weapon.\nThe rocket system for this missile has been developed jointly by the Pune-based Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE) and High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL). The missile system is now cleared for production as in this missile DRDO and the user was present right from the starting which reduced the number of tests that has to be done though some more tests may be conducted if the Indian army wants but that is unlikely to happen as the missile had validated itself and was a successful textbook launch.\n"

    "answer": "Our Current Prime Minister is a real Aam Admi, may be he has a lot power now but we tend to forget who he was and from where he came to this position. The real life struggle always count to understand and feel others problems. Being a politician he need to behave in certain way and he does that brilliantly. His name was tarnished by many who never wanted him as their competitor because they know’s what can happen if he comes to the power. We can now see a great marketing professional, a superb administrator and a seasoned politician balancing all acts together with control and passion.\n He is not only connected to the best entrepreneurs of the world, but also connected to every sect and society of india and even outside india. We will focus his Muslim friendly attitude and reasons why muslims should feel anything bad about him, which is propagated by people who don’t want growth but need only filthy promotion and ways to stop growth of the country.\n Modi Ji in Saudi Arabia With Muslim Friends in Mosque\nThe biggest thing that happened with his rising to power is building of more international friends starting from Muslim countries to Buddhist to Secular to Christian countries. He is even has friend in communist ruled china, it’s important we understand the meaning and importance of having more quality friend than enemy’s around you, and that’s what he did.\n Let’s see Our Prime Minister how weak he was when he started his political life and where he was.\n Narendra Modi as a Sadhu :\n Gradually moving to Politics :\nJust Entered Full Scale Politics and faced with India’s two biggest historic events one is Godhra Riot and then Bhuj Earthquake, it’s like a fresher given the duty to run Microsoft, how would he feel and what he can do? After all he is a human we must never forget that and he could also quit from all these chaos, he don’t even have family, why would he work so hard, for what he will pile money, but he never quit and that is commendable?\n IN THE BURNT TRAIN AT GODHRA WITH OUR EX PRIME MINISTER SHREE ATAL BIHARI VAJPAYEE\nREQUESTING TO MAINTAIN PEACE AND HARMONY DURING RIOTS\nNOW SEE THIS VIDEO, HERE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND HOW HE WAS MALIGNED\n In India Today Conclave\nIt is easy to malign a person with political power but if he has the will power he can come out of it, that’s what he has proved.\n Now a very simple thing was made an issue where he seemingly just accepted one gift from a muslim person as it was a public meeting not all like a muslim cap. And that was made an issue, just think what is politics. And listen to his clarification.\nNOW SEE HOW HE SPENT TIME WITH MUSLIM LEADERS IN RAMZAN\n NOW YOU THINK WHAT IS CORRECT.\n"

    "question": "Why do some dogs’ breath smell so bad?",
    "answer": "Bad breath of dogs is medically known as Halitosis. There are a variety of reasons which cause bad breath/Halitosis in dogs but it is mostly because of tartar or plaque build up. The primary cause of bad breath in dogs is bad bacteria causing decay that creates smelly sulfur compounds. Volatile sulfur compounds may also play a role in periodontal disease affecting the integrity of the tissue barrier, allowing endotoxins (a part of bacteria) to produce periodontal destruction, endotoxemia (endotoxins in the blood), and bacteremia (bacteria in the blood).\n Brushing your dog's teeth regularly, using a dental spray such as “Dentapet” dental spray will help to remove the bad odor. If the plaque or tartar is too much then you can remove it through cleaning of the tartar.\n[LINKED_TEXT: https://wiggles.in/product/DentaPet%E2%84%A2%20Organic%20Dental%20Spray%20(10ml%20-%20Dogs%20and%20Cats)] [URL: https://wiggles.in/product/DentaPet%E2%84%A2%20Organic%20Dental%20Spray%20(10ml%20-%20Dogs%20and%20Cats)]"

    "question": "How can women build muscle if they have low testosterone?",
    "answer": "Building muscle is often associated with high testosterone levels, a hormone predominantly found in men. But what about women, especially those with low testosterone? Understanding the unique physiology of women can lead to effective strategies for muscle development, even with lower testosterone levels.\n For women, building muscle is primarily about consistent strength training, adequate protein intake, and a balanced diet. While testosterone does play a role in muscle growth, it's not the only factor at play. Therefore, even if you have low testosterone levels, you can still build muscle.\n Strength training is crucial. Regular resistance exercises, like weightlifting, stimulate muscle protein synthesis. This process repairs and strengthens the muscle fibers that were broken down during your workout, leading to muscle growth.\n Moreover, a diet rich in protein provides the necessary building blocks for this muscle repair and growth. The recommended dietary allowance for protein is 46 grams per day for women, but if you're regularly strength training, you may need more to support muscle growth.\n Balanced nutrition doesn't stop with protein. Your body needs a variety of nutrients to function optimally and build muscle, including healthy fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals.\n Also, don't forget the importance of recovery. Rest days and good sleep are essential for muscle growth and repair. Without proper recovery time, your muscle-building efforts might be counterproductive.\n For women with low testosterone who are struggling to build muscle, supplementation can be a game-changer. While testosterone boosters are often marketed towards men, certain supplements can safely and effectively support muscle growth in women.\n Testosil™, is tailored specifically for women seeking to enhance their muscle growth. Testosil™ is packed with essential amino acids and other natural ingredients that support protein synthesis and muscle recovery, making it an excellent adjunct to your workout and nutrition regimen.\n Though testosterone levels can influence muscle growth, it's far from the whole story. With consistent strength training, adequate protein intake, balanced nutrition, and strategic supplementation with products like Testosil™, women can effectively build muscle, even if their testosterone levels are lower.\n Ready to take your fitness journey to the next level? Discover the benefits of Testosil™ and our comprehensive range of health and fitness supplements on our website at\n[LINKED_TEXT: https://tiny.youthregain.com/Quora1] [URL: https://tiny.youthregain.com/Quora1]Let's unlock your strength potential together.\n"

    "question": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a non-geared two-wheeler over a geared one?",
    "answer": "Advantages:\n [LINKED_TEXT: 1. ] [URL: http://1.no/]No clutch adjustment required. Because there is no clutch cable .\n 2. No need to change gears. Because there is no gear shifter.\n 3. Petrol can't be stolen atleast its cumbersome to do so on a scooter or if it is a motorcycle like africa twin again same as above as its cumbersome or nearly impossible for a layman to get to the fuel outlet.\n 4. Old school front and rear lever brake setup in scooters and mostly nowadays it comes with cbs and in some we get abs so that is even more perfect to brake both brakes at the same time using just levers and not footpedal. In gear less motorcycles again no clutch lever and gear shifter so just the right hand and right leg coordination is also a good combo for perfect braking because our subconscious mind doesnt have to bother about clutch and gears and all tht.\n 5. Beltdrive in scooters lasts much longer than conventional chain type in motorcycles. Its enclosed and its very cheap to buy too.\n 6. Scooters can take more luggage without much effort like tying and all that.. Underseat storage is like u can lock things up and front floorboard can take anythin from gas cylinders to water cans(20 litres) to anythin.. If u have a backpack keep em between ur legs in the floor board and ride without worries and its got locky docks too.\n 7. If it rains just open the seat keep mobilephone purse etc inside it close the seat and ride. As simple as tht. Storage is the main advantage.\n Disadvantages:\nScooters are fun but not so much like on a motorcycle. Scooters can take u places but as in india except 2 or 3 scooters others cant cross 90 kmph. so cruising and doing long distance touring is not possible unless you have patience to tour on much lower average speeds. Exception africa twin and such gearless motorcycles.Mileage is not that great comparing similar cc motorcycles.For any tuning of carb, replacement of cables etc its very tiring as its not simple to access like on a motorcycle. Must remove plenty of bolts here n thr and lift the whole rear part and do lil stuffs.Not very torquey. And if stuck in a pothole motorcycles can be switched to a lower gear and with help of clutch can be taken out of the situation. Here all we can do is rev and hope we get out.and with pillion in that situation, yeah both can get off the scooter anytime and push it out. Same goes with heavy pillion rides but on a motorcycle speedy pickup and gear changin on tight rpm and time can make ride interesting but in scooters rev or brake thats it.Not fun as geared motorcycle.Very dangerous on a hill station ride especially downhill.. No proper engine braking, no gears so cant downshift for more engine braking and all we can depend on are brakes and if thats out of shape or overheated then its a one way journey upward 💯👍\n"

    "question": "Why is it called electrostatics if the charges are not that really at rest? For example is the charges from the doorknob that would be transferred to you if touch. What is really the key term to understand electrostatics over electrodynamics?",
    "answer": "The names ElectroStatic and ElectroMagnetic were chosen long before we understood the mechanism of either form of radiation. Electrostatic force is the Coulomb force between particles with charge at essentially no velocity relative to each other. How and if the force changes with relative velocity near c and the quantum mechanism that makes it radiate and propagate we still do not know.\n ElectroMagnetic radiation is caused by forcedly oscillating a charge which already radiates electrostatic force such as electrons in the antenna of a radio-transmitter, or electrons in a light bulb. Electromagnetic radiation is consequently technically an ES wave with the frequency of the forced “EM” oscillation superimposed on the higher nuclear frequency of the ES carrier.\n Electromagnetism supports the same conclusion that rather than involving imaginary magnetic fields the forces at play is a compounding of Coulomb forces between a multitude of untethered electrons or quanta of charge in motion singularly or part of currents of electric charge.\n"

    "question": "What really makes \"acoustic\" instruments sound so different to synthesized ones? Listening to 60s pop/rock I'm impressed by how many instruments seem to \"fit\" into the mix compared to when I use synths in a DAW.",
    "answer": "Partly its an issue of how much you can control. Synths can produce near unlimited types of sounds and we use them as if we are sculpting or building. An acoustic instrument tends to just be there. They are developed over centuries or decades. They have a ‘natural’harmonic content which seems to be a product of veing mechanical in origin: plenty of overtones but they roll off across the spectrum and vary considerably between instruments. Synth waves either will be a sine: no harmonics. Or any of the others tend to contain too much and need subtractive filters manually added as is the basis of subtractive synthesis. The other insteicacies of adsr also have to be tuned in too and this will play into how things work together, like you may want some synths sustaining and others decaying quickly based on simply that its easier to make things work when they arent actually filling the same space in time so transients help distinguish this.\n Another is of course we know what ensembles work together too. Bass guitar drums work together. Even a lot of avante garde stuff follows that, although the guitar may have effects or additional instruments may be added.\n Finally if we are talking electric guitars you can EQ with the amp and choice of equipment from pickups to mics. So minimal mixing EQ is needed. Synth music is mostly all in the box so these selections are partly just transferred. Some people will send synths through amps as they give a natural EQ (+distortion and ambience) to help them sit especially with electroacoustic instruments. Id add sometimes it can be bloody hard to mic a fully acoustic ensemble or even single instrument, but once the miccing is done you dont/cant do much with mix processing\n"

    "question": "Why would Klobuchar, Buttigieg, and Steyers drop out before seeing how they do on Super Tuesday?",
    "answer": "Was Steyers even in the race? Seems like he was wasting his time.\n Klobuchar did OK for a first time candidate, and she gave a good showing in the debates. She outlasted a LOT of other candidates. But she stood no real chance of winning anywhere in the Super Tuesday ballot, and that includes her home state. By walking away before the big event, she preserves her dignity… and that means she can go into 2024 as a seasoned candidate who learned valuable lessons and should be taken seriously. Super Tuesday would only weaken that\n The same is true, only even moreso, of Buttigieg. He did very well early on, but didn’t manage to build on that, and those were his strongest prospects. His only hope was to use early wins to advance his position in later states… but when Sanders and then Biden beat him, he had lost the tempo. Walking away prior to Super Tuesday puts him in a better position in 2024 than staying and being shellacked there…\n Endorsing Biden, who is likely to do very well in Super Tuesday and who is also a moderate, like each of them, means they get even more cred, they can claim a part of any success he has.\n They also make themselves look like good VP candidates, and you have to remember, Biden is (like the other three remaining candidates) older than dirt and in need of a strong younger VP.\n Basically, dropping out when they did was all upside for them… they weren’t going to win, and there was no compelling reason to stay in and take the hit.\n"

The new Note 20 , iPhone 12 , P40 Pro Plus and upcoming Huawei Mate 40 Pro should all have decent camera and battery life as well. Huawei and Apple currently have the best security hence the US ban on Huawei as the US government has no backdoor access to their phones. Latest leaked specs show that the iPhone 13 will have a much more advanced camera system than the iPhone 12 as it's going to have to compete with phones using the new 150MP Samsung sensors when it is released. Battery in life depends a lot on the type of usage so it's hard to judge battery life accurately . Sony currently have the best battery management and least overheating issues.

    "question": "Why does my Samsung Tab S7 lag when I swipe down the notification panel or when I switch to recent apps?",
    "answer": "When a high-end tablet like the Galaxy Tab S7 starts to lag, then it’s probably just a minor firmware-related problem. That’s always the case with powerful devices that have performance issues. Needless to say, you can fix the problem by doing some basic troubleshooting procedures. So here’s what you should do:\n First solution: Close background apps\nWhen it comes to fixing lags and freezes, the first thing you have to look into are the apps that are left running in the background. There are apps that might cause any device to become sluggish.\nTo do so, tap the Recent Apps key on your tablet. This will show you the apps running in the background.Now tap Close All to quit them all at once.\nCheck to see if the device stills lags.\n Second solution: Force restart your tablet\n Another thing you have to do is the forced restart, especially if the first solution failed to fix the problem. The Forced restart will refresh your tablet’s memory as well as reload all its apps and services. It’s effective against issues like this. Here’s how you do it:\nPress and hold the Volume Down button and the Power key for 10 seconds. This will trigger your tab to shut down and power back up.Once the logo shows, release both keys and wait until it has finished rebooting.\nAfter the restart, try to see if your tablet still lags or if the problem is fixed.\n If it stills does try this fix\n Third solution: Run your device in safe mode.\n After doing the first two solutions and your Galaxy Tab S7 is still lagging, then try running it in Safe mode. In doing so, you’re temporarily disabling all third-party applications, which might be causing the problem. Here’s how:\nSwipe down from the top of the screen, and tap the Power icon.Tap and hold on the Power off option until it turns into Safe mode.Tap Safe mode to restart your tablet.\nOnce in safe mode, try to see if your device still lags. If the problem is fixed, then look for the apps that are causing the problem and uninstall them. However, if the issue remains, then move on to the next solution. Safe mode will only load with apps that do not have any issues , so this will help you identify any app that's affecting your device.\n"

    "question": "Was the space shuttle program good, or should NASA have chosen something else?",
    "answer": "The Space Shuttle was an exciting opportunity and it performed a vital role in the 80s, 90s and Early 2000s despite a couple of unfortunate setbacks. Many technologies used in the Shuttle served as a part in the new designs. Realistically speaking, space travel and even air travel using large ships is a complex endeavour and is quiet unforgiving as we saw with the space shuttle loses. Air industry suffered far more loses until the designs became stable, just look at Air Crash Investigations and count how many test pilots lost their lives or WW2 and other conflicts aircraft designs and loses. Boeing, Airbus did not come from vacuum. Space Travel is expensive, complex, dangerous and demanding, but determination and persistent efforts will pay-off one day. The latest test which exploded few minutes after take-off is a good example of designs, trials and redesigning before we trust such machines with Human Lives. Apollo did not come from vacuum, many rocks were list before a stable design was achieved.\n"

    "question": "What are the main differences between musicals and operas?",
    "answer": "The differences in these two genres are vast. The main one is that in a traditional art of opera, singers are not amplified. Opera singers train for years to be able to produce such powerful sounds that the audience in a big theater like the Metropolitan Opera can hear them. This in itself is incredible!\n Musical theater provides singers with mics and thus, Broadway singers don’t have such need to project their voices (even though it’s a great skill any professional singer, be it pop, rock, or whatever would benefit from).\n Also, in opera, it’s the symphonic orchestration and the complexity of the music. In comparison to musical theater, there are no electric instruments used in opera. This is because, electric instruments didn’t exist when Mozart, Verdi, Bizet, Tchaikovsky wrote their masterpieces:)\n Opera productions incorporate other classical art forms such as ballet. Classical composers and librettists provisions for such scenes in their operas.\n Finally, operas are sung in Italian, French, German, Russian, and other languages while when we think of musical theater English dominates the stage.\n"

    "question": "What is dark matter? What is it made up of? Will we be able to create it?",
    "answer": "The most plausible explanation is that the infinite number of bubble universes “overlap” where each bubble is a spaceworld in itself. The bubbles are super-inflated from an abstract proto-universe and each has its own ether substrate (imagine that each ether is of different colour and that there are infinite number of shades of these colours). These ethers affect each other, and we know from Tesla’s Dynamic Gravitation theory that ether affects all bodies in the universe through electro-magnetic force - there are no static charges in the universe. If any light bending is discovered in the inter galactic regions of space in our bubble universe, that will be the proof of the multiverse existence. Moreover, the multiverse theory of cosmology and multi-world interpretation of quantum mechanics will be unified. At the same time, mathematics of infinity will have to advance in order to explain these phenomena (currently, there are holes in the very foundations of mathematics, in particular the continuum hypothesis).\n Thus there are no “dark” stuff, energy is one and only. Infinite number of bubble universes affect each other and we observe the effects of this (just like we observe a “centripetal” force when in essence there is none: a satellite constantly falls toward Earth due to a “gravitational” force, but as it falls, the Earth curves down the same distance - approx. 1m every 8 km - giving the impression of curved path of the falling satellite).\n"

    "question": "Why is there so little trash on the streets of Vancouver, British Columbia, relative to any other city, such as San Francisco?",
    "answer": "Vancouver has more natural beauty than any other big metropolis on the planet. The north coast mountains, English Bay off the Pacific Ocean, which is protected from the worst storms by Vancouver Island, a temperate rain forest with massive trees, fauna on the water's edge, and an active volcano, Mt. Baker, which serves as a stand-in for Mt. Fuji.\n Sydney is also as blessed with nature. So is San Francisco. Other cities around the world are as well. However, in 1886 Vancouver established Stanley Park, a 1001-acre oasis of mostly-untouched trees. With the Agricultural Land Reserve in 1973 and the Green Zone in 1996, Vancouver set major constraints on urban growth.\n In 1989, they constructed View Corridors to allow everyone to enjoy the beauty of the surrounding area. They began the 22-kilometre Vancouver Seawall in 1917 and established urban planning principles and regulations that obliged developers developing on the waterfront to extend and maintain the seawall with unrestricted access and flow through for all.\n This has not only kept people confined in specific development areas, but it also made all of that beautiful environment available to everyone. Despite the fact that Vancouver is less dense than many Asian and South American cities, it is nevertheless possible to get around on foot, bicycle, or public transportation far more swiftly and simply than in the majority of cities across the world.\n The climate and winter rains keep Vancouver green all year, and dust and filth don't stick around for long, even if you live near a construction site, as it is washed away.\n The air, the streets, and the beaches are all pristine. Since British Columbia has such strong hydropower resources, it generates 93 percent of its electricity from this source, resulting in virtually no fossil fuel-related pollution from the electrical system.\n In Vancouver, the Fraser Valley is the only area that can be considered remotely dirty since can get a little foggy at times due to the number of people who still drive automobiles, but it's nothing compared to other parts of the world.\n"

    "answer": "Hi there! MAC and Android are two completely different operating systems with different user interfaces and functionalities. Here are some main differences between the two:\n Hardware: Mac is an operating system designed to run on Apple's hardware, such as Macbooks, iMacs, and Mac Minis. In contrast, Android is designed to run on a variety of hardware devices, including smartphones, tablets, and smart TVs, from different manufacturers.\n User Interface: The user interface of Mac and Android is also different. Mac has a desktop-based interface, while Android has a mobile-based interface that includes touch controls and swipe gestures.\n App Ecosystem: The app ecosystem of Mac and Android is also different. Mac has its own app store, the Mac App Store, which includes applications that are designed specifically for Mac. Android has the Google Play Store, which includes a wide variety of apps, including those designed specifically for Android as well as those that are available on other platforms.\n Customizability: Android is known for its customizability. Users can customize the look and feel of their Android devices by installing third-party launchers, themes, and widgets. Mac, on the other hand, has limited customization options.\n Security: Mac is generally considered to be more secure than Android, as Apple's closed ecosystem and strict App Store policies make it harder for malware and viruses to infect the system. Android, on the other hand, is more open, which makes it more vulnerable to security threats.\n Overall, the main difference between Mac and Android is that Mac is designed for desktop and laptop computers, while Android is designed for mobile devices.\n"

    "question": "Are there any planets outside of our solar system?",
    "answer": "Yes, planets can form or exist outside of a solar system, and these are known as exoplanets. Exoplanets are planets that orbit a star other than our Sun, and they are usually detected through their gravitational influence on their host star or by observing their transit across the face of their star.\n Exoplanets come in a wide variety of sizes and compositions, and they can have a wide range of orbital properties and environmental conditions. Some exoplanets are similar in size and composition to the planets in our own Solar System, while others are very different.\n Exoplanets can exist in a variety of environments, such as in binary star systems, where two stars orbit each other, or in systems with multiple stars. Exoplanets can also be found in regions of space far from any stars, such as rogue planets, which do not orbit any star and instead travel through space on their own.\n The discovery of exoplanets has revolutionized our understanding of planetary systems and has opened up new avenues for the search for life beyond our Solar System.\n"

    "question": "Would living on the ceiling of a mined out area inside a fast rotating asteroid be more feasible than fully constructing a space colony station?",
    "answer": "Yes, and here's how it would work. First you pick a medium to small asteroid 'rubble pile' with favorable material and few large boulders. Second you 'encase' the entire outside of the asteroid in the shape you eventually want, which will be larger than the asteroid. 200 meter diameter is reasonable given the rotation rate of 2 rpm and about 1 g on the shell. (A short wide cylinder is considered best for stability when spinning, imagine two tuna cans stacked for the shape.) Third you very slowly spin up your cylinder which will slowly cause the grain and pebbles to 'fall' on to the outside shell which then you can spread evenly as more and larger rocks make their way to the shell. Eventually you may wish to directly move the larger rocks and boulders to the shell to prevent unwanted collisions, and to create a balanced distribution. Now you have your rotating shell of a space station ready to add all the sundry equipment that human life needs and the shielding and induced gravity is already there.\n"

    "question": "Just like blood and bone marrow is it possible to get insulin from another human why do we get it from animals?",
    "answer": "We don’t use insulin from animals any more. That’s history. Even when commercial insulin was made that way, it required the slaughter of thousands and thousands of animals—usually calves and pigs—to obtain enough to be useful. (They weren’t slaughtered just for this; the insulin was gotten from the pancreases of animals slaughtered for the meat industry.) So it would be a little troubling to slaughter thousands of people to get insulin to treat others with diabetes. Some ethical nit-pickers might object, even if we only used orphans or street children from third-world ghettos.\n Anyway, we’ve done away with animal insulin. Since 1982, pharmaceutical companies have made much purer human insulin by means of cultures of recombinant bacteria or yeast in bioreactors (fermentation tanks) like these. The insulin on the market now is thus made by genetically engineered Escherichia coli and Saccaharomyces cerevisiae.\n[LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #tmAQb] No longer do diabetic patients rely on insulin from cattle or pigs, with its risks of impurities and allergic reactions.

Usually, the people who had sat tight and weathered the storms tended to do better. Its like the stock market. Do you bail out every time nasty winds blow around the stock market? If you did that you'd never get anywhere financially. Germany and Austrian Empire were actually some of rhe most open places for Jewish people after the Napoleonic wars ended. Jews were regular citizens and owned homes and businesses on an equal footing with Christians. By comparison in Czarist Russia they couldn't own land, enter professions, get fair legal trials etc. And they would get killed in waves of pograms. Germany was seen as enlightened and fair in comparison. Many Jews thought they could “ride it out\" until it was too late. And it gets harder to move to a new country and culture as you get older and you would tend to try to wait it out. Many Jews who did get out got depressed in their new countries. Look at German philosooher Stephan Zwieg. Somebody got him out of Germany and into a teaching professorship in the US, but he and his wife struggled with adapting to life in English etc and they eventually committed suicide together.\n"

    "question": "What is swing trading?",
    "answer": "Typically, swing trading involves holding a long or short position for more than one trading session, but usually no longer than several weeks or a few months. This is a general time frame as some trades may last longer than a few months, but the trader may still consider them swing trades. Swing trades can also occur during a trading session, although this is a rare outcome caused by extremely volatile conditions.\n The goal of swing trading is to capture part of a potential price movement. While some traders look for volatile stocks with a lot of movement, others may prefer quieter stocks. In any case, swing trading is the process of identifying where an asset's price is likely to move next, taking a position, and then capturing a portion of the profit when that move occurs.\n To learn about swing trading, check out [LINKED_TEXT: Best Options Trading Alerts Service | Options Swing Trade Alerts | Foolproof Options] [URL: http://foolproofoptions.com/].

Here are the steps:\nWe start by making a change of variable to eliminate the quadratic term. Let x = y - 2/3b. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n8(y - 2/3b)³ - 6(y - 2/3b) - 1 = 0\n Expanding and simplifying, we get:\n 8y³ - 36by² + 48b²y - 27b³ - 6y + 4b = 0\nWe now look for a value of p such that the equation can be written in the form:\ny³ + py = q\n where q and p are constants.\n We can see that p = -6/8 = -3/4. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n y³ - 3/4y = -1/8\nWe now need to find the values of u and v such that:\nu³ = -q/2 + sqrt(q²/4 + p³/27) v³ = -q/2 - sqrt(q²/4 + p³/27)\n where sqrt denotes the square root function.\n Substituting the values of p and q, we get:\n u³ = 27/8 + sqrt(729/64 + 27/64) v³ = 27/8 - sqrt(729/64 + 27/64)\n Simplifying, we get:\n u³ = 9 + 3sqrt(3) v³ = 9 - 3sqrt(3)\nWe can now solve for y by using the formulas:\ny = u^(1/3) + v^(1/3)\n where u and v are the values obtained in step 3.\n Substituting the values of u and v, we get:\n y = (9 + 3sqrt(3))^(1/3) + (9 - 3sqrt(3))^(1/3)\nFinally, we can solve for x by using the formula:\nx = y - 2/3b\n where b is the coefficient of the quadratic term in the original equation.\n Substituting the value of y and the value of b = -6/8 = -3/4, we get:\n x = (9 + 3sqrt(3))^(1/3) + (9 - 3sqrt(3))^(1/3) - 1/2\n Therefore, the solution to the equation 8x³ - 6x - 1 = 0 by Cardano's method is:\n x = (9 + 3sqrt(3))^(1/3) + (9 - 3sqrt(3))^(1/3) - 1/2\n"

If you’re trying to sound like a native speaker as a communicative tool, don’t - most of us find accents charming provided we can understand you. If that’s your goal, then practice practice practice, but don’t try to lose the accent completely - learn songs until you can sign them without looking at the lyrics. Incorporate some of that language into your everyday speech. If you want to do some serious studying learn the IPA: [LINKED_TEXT: ipachart] [URL: http://www.phonetics.ucla.edu/course/chapter1/chapter1.html] that’s an alphabet of sounds meaning 1 symbol = 1 sound. Learning the different sounds is important because the first step to producing a sound is being able to perceive it. If you don’t have a sound or sound combination in your language, then it’s difficult to pronounce. For example, the sound /ng/ never appears at the beginning of a word in English but is very common in Vietnamese. So although we have the sound in English it’s difficult for us to pronounce when it comes at the beginning of a word like in the common Vietnamese name Nguyen.\n"

    "question": "How do homeless people survive?",
    "answer": "Homeless individuals may struggle to survive during the winter due to the lack of access to warm shelter and adequate clothing. They may seek out shelters, which can provide a warm place to sleep and access to basic needs such as food and clothing. Some cities and organizations also provide warming centers or \"extreme weather shelters\" that open during periods of extremely cold or snowy weather.\n Individuals experiencing homelessness may also rely on community resources such as soup kitchens and food pantries, or they may receive assistance from charitable organizations or government programs. It's not uncommon for people to stay in overcrowded shelters or sleep in cars or tents, those situations are not ideal, even they are better than nothing, and a lot of the homeless don’t have access to these facilities.\n Additionally, some homeless people may try to stay warm by using public spaces such as libraries, shopping malls, and transit stations that are open to the public and heated. They may also try to stay active during the day to generate heat, and may use newspapers, cardboard, or other materials to insulate themselves from the cold ground. It's important to notice that the survival of homeless people in harsh winter is a huge challenge, which requires a comprehensive approach, including providing them with decent shelter, adequate healthcare, and social services, as well as increasing access to affordable housing.\n"

    "question": "How hard was it for ancient civilizations to invent the wheel?",
    "answer": "The wheel as a circular spinning object mounted to an axle? Probably not so hard.\n The wheel as a means to transport heavy loads over distances with minimum effort? Really hard.\n Depending on what it was used for, the wheel could be easily crafted without taking into consideration other factors that would make it cumbersome for another task.\nAbove is the picture of a potter's wheel. Not ancient, but a good representation. For the purposes of making pottery, the wheel does not have to withstand heavy loads and does not need to have a perfectly circular shape. So long as it spins, the clay can be molded. It also does not require minimal friction between the axle and the wheel well and definitely no need for good grip.\nAbove is the simplest form of a wagon wheel — a circular wooden stump hollowed in the middle to allow mounting to an axle. While easy to manufacture, the main problem with this design is its weight coupled with a high moment of inertia. Heavier wheels are harder to spin and thus more difficult to propel. They also are not perfectly circular owing to the quality of tools at the time (earliest wheels were dated back to the late neolithic). The bearings (if you could call it that) were not that great either. Add to that the fact that bare wood does not have good traction especially when wet.\n All this makes it hard to utilise the wheel on terrible—even moderate—ground. You would need a really good surface and a lot of power. Hence why oxen were so valuable and even then, they could only pull the wagon so fast.\n Such wheeled wagons were not even used widely.\n Fast forward to the middle bronze age when the spoked wheel was invented.\nIt was a compromise but such is the way of engineering— and it was a mavelous compromise. First of all, unlike a hollowed wood stump, it was closer to a perfect circle. It was a lot lighter, and just durable enough to withstand the load and speeds it is subjected to. Addition of leather strips around the wheel improved traction to compensate for a narrower footprint. Due to the light weight, the radius can be increased without increasing the moment of inertia. A larger wheel can cover a longer distance with each rotation. This “reinvention\" of the wheel allowed it to be used extensively for farming, trade, and war.\n So while the wheel was invented as early as the late neolithic, it took a few thousand years to improve it to the point that it was used massively.\n Imagine trying to solve one problem for thousands of years. That's hard.\n References:\n[LINKED_TEXT: Wheel - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel][LINKED_TEXT: Spoke - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoke]\n"

    "answer": "So you have two things that throw your compass off of true, variation and deviation. And whole they are seperate phenomena one does effect the other to a small degree.\n Variation is the difference that magnetic north is off from true north, it is predictable and the exact number can be found on navigational charts for the area.\n Deviation is error induced by the vessels own, electro-magnetic influences. Some of which can be minimized by various methods (twisting hot and negative wired in dc circuits togethe so their fields cancle out is just one example) or compensated for by the addition of magnets or ferrous masses sometimes both, to correct out own ship induced errors.\n Unfortunately you will never get it exactly perfect as when the vessels course is altered so are the interactions between the various magnetic fields at play, some will try to reinforce each other, others wi try to cancle each other out, and as you continue the turn these influences interact differently, producing different levels of interference at the compass.\n The best you can do is to average out the errors as best as possible and keep a deviation chart that lists what the error is for various headings.\n"

    "answer": "There are two reasons of using wards. First of all it keeps his father under check. If Balon rebels then he condemns the boy to his death. Since Balon offered his boy to the king on the sole condition that the king will keep him safe as long as Balon stays in line then that death will be equal to kinslaying which is a big taboo even on the iron islands.. The second reason was it gave mainland Westeros the opportunity to shape the heir to the iron islands the way they wanted him. Balon won’t live forever and Theon should have become more of a Stark then a Greyjoy. If Balon dies, he appoints someone else as heir and his heir decides to act silly then the crown would have a ready made substitution for him in Theon.\n By forcing him to become a member of the NW, Ned would lose the very purpose of having Theon in the first place\n a- the death threat would be gone as the North has no jurisdiction over the order. If Ned or Robert insisted to have him executed then the NW would be obliged to defend their member\n b- Balon could easily put a crown over his head and release the boy from his vows.\n"

    "question": "Where do hybrid cars save the most fuel?",
    "answer": "The question is ambiguous. “Save” is a relative term, so you need to compare its fuel usage to something else, and direct comparisons will be hard. The implication is “when compared to a non-hybrid gas car that is driving the same way.” The problem with this is that hybrids tend to cycle between various drive modes, even when “driving the same way,” so there is no single answer.\n But situations where they use regenerative braking is not the answer. Car manufacturers don’t want to go into detailed engineering explanations for how hybrids are different than non-hybrids. The easiest one to explain is regen braking.\nNon-hybrids use very little fuel in braking situations. A hybrid can not only turn the engine off and use none, it can use its motor as a generator and gain charge in the battery,How much is gained varies quite a bit with how aggressively you brake, the speed from which you are stopping, the power of the motor, and the size of the battery. But no hybrid can recover more than about 50% of the energy that would be lost by a non-hybrid, and it can be as low as 10%. And since the hybrid usually use electricity to accelerate back up to the same speed, and there are other losses, a stop-restart cycle actually decreases the charge in the battery. Here is an actual plot of the State of Charge in a Prius during the test that determines EPA city mileage. The car stopped from 33 mph, idled for 30 seconds during which time some charge was used for other systems, and then accelerated back to 28 mph. The gray line is speed, and the black line represent different tests with different initial states of charge.\nIn the lower two plots, the engine actually runs to charge the battery. The point is that regen braking doesn’t save fuel, it just doesn’t waste as much. And that amount is not nearly as significant as what it put into the battery by running the engine.\nHybrids actually “save fuel” by running the engine at a more efficient level of power than is needed to propel the car. Excess energy is stored temporarily in the battery, and used later. Here is an efficiency map for the Honda Fit/Jazz that is sold in Europe and Asia:\nThese are really cartoons, so don’t try to interpret any numbers literally. The one on the left shows where a non-hybrid would run the engine three conditions: Urban (up to 25 mph), Extra Urban (25 to 50 mph), and Motorway/Highway (50 to 75 mph). The goal is to run the engine in the whitest are of the plot, and the non-hybrid fails pretty miserably.\n The cartoon on the right shows what this particular hybrid system does. It does look like it gains more in urban driving, but part of that is due to the cartoonish nature of the plots, so that you can see the different regions. The Accord hybrid using a similar system will put the red “Motorway” region between 1800 and 2,800 rpms.\n"

    "question": "What is a candid picture?",
    "answer": "A candid picture is a photograph taken without the subject's knowledge or without their posing for the camera. In other words, it is an unposed and natural image that captures the subject in a spontaneous moment. Candid photography aims to capture the essence of the moment and the subject's emotions, without the constraints of posing or artificial settings.\n Candid pictures can be taken in various contexts, such as at weddings, parties, or during travel. They are often used to capture people in their natural surroundings, doing what they do on a daily basis. The goal of candid photography is to capture the subject in a genuine moment, showcasing their personality and character.\n Candid photography requires a certain level of skill and technique to capture the moment quickly and effectively. It often involves using a fast shutter speed and being able to anticipate the subject's movements. Candid photography can be challenging, but when done well, it can produce powerful and authentic images that tell a story and evoke emotions in the viewer.\n"

    "question": "If the multiverse theory is true, isn't it inevitable that the universe collides with another universe as there is an infinite amount of universes all expanding?",
    "answer": "Hello, [LINKED_TEXT: Kai] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Kai-6114].\nQ: If the multiverse theory is true, isn't it inevitable that the universe collides with another universe as there is an infinite amount of universes all expanding?\nA: There are multiple multiverse hypotheses (not theory; also note the plural), and we cannot test any of them because our physics is limited to this universe.\n In for instance the eternal inflation hypothesis, there is an inflaton field expanding way faster than the speed of light. Our universe would then be a small bubble in that inflaton field which has slowed down, so that it only expands at 70 km/s per million parsec, way lower than the speed of light. So it would be impossible for any universe to collide with our universe.\n In for instance the predecessor black hole hypothesis, a new universe spawns as a black hole in an earlier universe.\n In the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics, any quantum event produces multiple timelines, one for each possible outcome. But since these happens on different timelines, the universe themselves cannot collide.\n And so on and so on.\n Basically, because multiverse hypotheses are hypothetical, we can almost make up any conclusion we want to support whatever fancy idea we have about multiverses.\n"

    "question": "How accurate is the depiction of Pharaohs in Ancient Egyptian art?",
    "answer": "The depiction of Pharaohs in Ancient Egyptian art can be considered accurate to some extent, but it is important to note that the art served multiple purposes beyond mere representation. Egyptian art, including the portrayal of Pharaohs, followed specific conventions and adhered to a standardized set of artistic principles that were developed over centuries.\n Here are a few key points to consider:\nSymbolism and Idealism: Ancient Egyptian art often aimed to convey the idealized image of the Pharaoh rather than a literal depiction. Pharaohs were depicted as powerful and divine rulers, often shown with idealized features, youthful appearances, and physical perfection. The art aimed to emphasize their authority, divinity, and eternal nature rather than capturing their exact physical appearance.Canonical Form: Egyptian art followed a canon of proportions and a standardized artistic style that prioritized clarity, order, and continuity over naturalistic representation. This led to a stylized and symbolic representation of the human form, with the Pharaoh depicted in a consistent manner across different periods and dynasties.Hierarchy and Symbolic Motifs: Pharaohs were often depicted larger in scale than other figures in the artwork, indicating their elevated status. They were shown wearing distinctive royal regalia, such as the Double Crown or the Blue Crown, which were symbolic of their authority and sovereignty. Other symbolic motifs, such as the cobra and vulture headdresses, conveyed their divine power and protection.Narrative Context: Egyptian art often served a narrative purpose, illustrating specific events, religious rituals, or mythological stories. The portrayal of Pharaohs within these narratives may involve symbolism and allegory that goes beyond literal representation.\nWhile Ancient Egyptian art provides valuable insights into the representation of Pharaohs, it is important to interpret it within its cultural and artistic context. The artistic conventions and stylistic choices were influenced by religious, political, and social factors, resulting in an idealized and symbolic portrayal of Pharaohs rather than a purely realistic depiction.\n"

    "question": "Does Vietnamese bolero have any relationship to Spanish or Cuban bolero? If not, why is Vietnamese bolero called \"bolero\" instead of something else?",
    "answer": "Bolero (boléro) originates from Spain and Cuba. Spanish and Cuban bolero songs focus on love and plenty of sentimental lyrics. Their songs are played in a medium and average tempo. Bolero started to grow in Vietnam in 1950, when Vietnamese music was developing at the time. Many artists and musicians were impressed by the eastern traditional tune and melody. So, they began using bolero rhythm in their songs. This type of music become popular all of the sudden. Right now, there isn’t any official history record of Vietnamese bolero.\n Vietnamese bolero songs are similar to southern Vietnamese folk-songs. The tempo and the rhythm of bolero songs are pretty slow and soft, which make it easy to listen. Unlike Spanish and Cuban bolero songs, Vietnamese bolero depicts a sad story or an unfortunate experience of life that is familiar to the people.\n For more information and reference and websites credited:\n [LINKED_TEXT: Bolero - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolero]\n [LINKED_TEXT: Bolero Việt Nam – Wikipedia tiếng Việt] [URL: https://vi.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolero_Vi%E1%BB%87t_Nam] (credited website)\n [LINKED_TEXT: #1 Nhạc Bolero là gì Xuất xứ dòng Boléro và sự phát triển ở VN] [URL: https://massageishealthy.com/nhac-bolero.html] (credited website)\n Here is a link of famous Vietnamese bolero song if you want to check it out:\nHope this answer help you.\n"

    "question": "New theory: in Endgame, could Tony Stark have given Steve Rogers a metal shield (instead of vibranium) before the final battle since he is still a little mad at him? Could that be why Thanos broke it so easily?",
    "answer": "The reason it broke is simple. Thanos is hitting it harder than it has ever been hit before, and with that level of force being applied to a very small surface area. For comparison, look at a polar bear. Due to the large surface area of its feet, it can walk pretty safely across fairly thin ice because the weight and pressure are spread out. By comparison a human could stand on the same piece of ice and plunge straight through, despite weighing only a fraction of the total weight, and a knife dropped from chest height would likely pierce the ice despite weight again being significantly less. The vibranium displaces / absorbs the kinetic energy of attacks, hence the crazy cool effect in the original Avengers film when Thor hits it with enough force that it ought to liquify even Steve’s enhanced skeleton. But Thanos is using a ridiculously sharp blade, likely crafted from something that is at least as strong as vibranium, to attack the edge of the shield, and he is very, very angry. That’s more than enough to start to crack it and then break it. There is also precedent with BP having been able to scratch the shield as vibranium is the only material (on earth) that can damage vibranium.\n Alternative head-canon is that it’s actually Steve’s fault because he is channelling the power of Thor. The electrical current flowing through him and thus into the shield could destabilise the intermolecular bonds between the vibranium atoms and thus make it more vulnerable to being damaged.\n"

    "question": "As a proud Texan, I believe that for profit healthcare is the best system, it allows maximum profit for shareholders and companies. Why do folks in Europe, Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand think that they are entitled to free healthcare?",
    "answer": "Whilst a for profit healthcare certainly allows for maximum profit, that very element ensures that claims are rejected wherever possible and premiums and co-pays will continue to increase to satisfy the increasing profit demands of investors. This happens at the expense of a healthy workforce… it should be not because of cost that people don’t go to the doctor resulting in no preventive care and often leaving a serious conditions until it’s too late.\n Your claim is inaccurate because universal medical programmes are not for free…. they are paid for through taxation and are implemented without a profit motive. When it comes to the wellbeing of citizens, it’s in the country’s best interest to leave profit out of any social programmes.\n In 32/33 developed countries,\nwe believe that when a country is wealthy, strong social programmes are essentialwe believe that good quality healthcare is a basic rightwe don’t want retired people to lose everything they have saved and invested because of medical bills, leaving them destitute and with no option to recover,we want to have poor, mentally ill and disabled people taken care of regardless of their financial situationwe want a child to have that transplant, regardless of the costwe don’t want our citizens going bankrupt because of medical expenses…. the US is the only developed country where this happens\nSo…. it’s definitely profit, the cost of which is often death.\n"

    "question": "What are some common mistakes to avoid when creating data visualizations?",
    "answer": "Here are some common mistakes to avoid when creating data visualizations:\nChoosing the wrong chart type. There are many different chart types available, and each one is best suited for a different type of data. Using the wrong chart type can make your data difficult to understand or even misleading.Using too much data. It's tempting to cram as much data as possible into a visualization, but this can make it cluttered and difficult to read. Instead, focus on the most important data points and use them to tell a clear story.Misleading color contrast. Color can be a powerful tool for data visualization, but it's important to use it carefully. Using too many colors or colors with poor contrast can make your visualization difficult to understand.Improper use of 3D graphics. 3D graphics can be visually appealing, but they can also be misleading. If you're using 3D graphics, make sure they're used in a way that doesn't distort the data.Omitting baselines and truncating scale. Baselines and scales are important for providing context to your data. Omitting them can make your visualization misleading or difficult to understand.Biased text descriptions. The text you use to describe your data should be objective and unbiased. Avoid using words that could lead the viewer to a particular conclusion.Zooming in on favorable data. It's tempting to zoom in on data that supports your argument, but this can be misleading. Make sure you zoom in on all of the data, not just the data that supports your point of view.\nBy avoiding these common mistakes, you can create data visualizations that are clear, informative, and engaging.\n"

    "question": "Zoroastrianism seems to be very different from other Middle Eastern religions, what is its unique appeal?",
    "answer": "Q: Zoroastrianism seems to be very different from other Middle Eastern religions, what is its unique appeal?\n Firstly, Zoroastrianism is about the only still wholly surviving religion traditionally present in the Middle East which is completely independent of the Abrahamic lore. The other extant traditional religious communities of the Middle East have religions which are either completely Abrahamic (like Islam, Christianity, Judaism or Samaritanism), semi-Abrahamic (like Yazidism) or at least related to Abrahamism (like Mandaeism).\n Secondly, Zoroastrianism is a religion rooted among the indiginous traditions of some Indo-European speakers, specifically of the Iranic subbranch. It is the only Indo-European religious tradition historically surviving in the Middle East, and nowadays moreover also pretty much the only wholly continuously surviving Indo-European religion from other than the Indian spectrum worldwide.\n Thirdly, the Iranic people actually lived roughly from the area of the contemporary Tajikistan in the Central Asia through the area of the contemporary Afghanistan to the area of the contemporary Iran in the Middle East. Zoroastrianism is widely considered to reflect in its roots the ancient Iranic cultural continuum stretching between the east of Iran and the Central Asia. It is thus not purely nor typically Middle Eastern religion, it is a religion anciently reflecting the easternmost periphery of the Middle East and/or beyond.*\n* “Avestan society represents one of the most difficult problems. Its has long been established that its material culture was archaic. The Avesta makes no mention of iron, although bronze was in use; and a sophisticated urban life, enduring states or crafts practised separately from farming are unknown. The Gāθās, the earliest part of the Avesta, which reflect the material culture and social relations of eastern Iran and Middle Asia in the pre-Achaemenid period, depict a society of sedentary herdsmen and farmers, still preserving a system of clan and tribal relationships. As the clan communes disintegrated, so early class units began to spring up, and the emergence of classes is reflected in the Gāθās, which contain a protest against the rule of the tribal elite.”(M. A. Dandamayev, in History of Civilizations of Central Asia: The Development of Sedentary and Nomadic Civilizations, 1994, p. 42)\n"

    "question": "Are there any disadvantages in using robots?",
    "answer": "While robots have many advantages and can be highly beneficial in various fields, there are also some potential disadvantages associated with their use. Here are a few commonly cited disadvantages:\nCost: Developing, purchasing, and maintaining robots can be expensive. The initial investment and ongoing maintenance costs may not be feasible for all individuals or organizations, particularly smaller ones with limited budgets.Job displacement: The automation of certain tasks and jobs through the use of robots can lead to job displacement for humans. As robots become more advanced and capable of performing complex tasks, there is a concern that they may replace human workers in certain industries, leading to unemployment or the need for workers to acquire new skills.Lack of adaptability: Robots are typically designed for specific tasks or environments. They often lack the flexibility and adaptability of human workers, who can quickly adjust to changing circumstances or perform a wide range of tasks. This limitation may make robots less suitable for tasks that require creativity, problem-solving, or handling unpredictable situations.Safety concerns: Robots are typically designed to operate in controlled environments, but they may not always handle unexpected situations or interact safely with humans. There is a risk of accidents or injuries if proper safety protocols are not followed or if the robots malfunction.Ethical considerations: As robots become more autonomous and capable, ethical considerations arise. Questions of responsibility and accountability can emerge when robots make decisions or take actions that have significant consequences. There is also a potential for misuse or malicious use of robots, such as in warfare or surveillance.Social implications: The widespread use of robots could have social implications. Some people may feel uncomfortable or anxious interacting with robots, particularly in social or caregiving roles where human connection and empathy are valued. The increasing reliance on robots in various domains may also contribute to a sense of alienation or job insecurity for some individuals.\nIt is important to note that the extent and significance of these disadvantages can vary depending on the specific context and application of robots. Additionally, ongoing technological advancements and ethical considerations may address or mitigate some of these concerns in the future.\n If you are looking for electronic manufacturing services, Morphedo offers a complete package for all manufacturing services like Engineering, Medical, IoT, AI, Aerospace & Defence, and Embedded Systems.\n Connect with them to know more.\n Morphedo Technologies Pvt.

    "question": "For pro-choice folks: If a man's wife or partner learns that she is pregnant and wants an abortion, should the father get a say in the decision if he wants to support and be there for the child?",
    "answer": "A healthy relationship involves honesty, trust, and open communication. That is to say, in a healthy relationship, they would have already decided, as a couple, what levels of risk of pregnancy were acceptable, and what they would do in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, before it became reality. The couple would also have the ability to change that decision at any time, considering the benefits and potential dangers of a pregnancy if it happened.\n So, the man would have learned from his partner that she was pregnant, and would already know the decision of abortion ahead of time, and therefore already had a say in his share of the relationship’s power dynamics. Of course, the couple could change their mind after finding out about the pregnancy. In an ideal relationship, the woman shouldn’t push for abortion without talking to her partner, and the man should not push for forced birth without talking to his partner.\n The decision to have a child, or not, should be a mutual decision, based on the couple’s collective decision considering the reasons why a child may or may not be the best option. It could be based on career planning, or finances, or academic pursuit, etc. However, at the end of the day, it is ultimately up to the woman to make that decision. It is a ...\n"

    "question": "What is served as breakfast in your country?",
    "answer": "Breakfast is the first meal you eat after you’ve slept. That can be anything at all, and frequently is. Here in the States, all the big cities and suburbs have places that are open 24/7, including police stations, hospitals, restaurants, hotels, service entities like fire departments an other first-responders, and businesses that deal extensively in foreign markets.\n Under these circumstances, it is often tough to have traditional breakfast foods to break the sleeping fast (that’s the origin of the word.)\n Traditional US breakfast foods include eggs prepared several ways, often with meats such as bacon, sausage, and scrapple (here in Philly and the surrounding regions, it’s a favorite), and some kind of fried potato dish. Pancakes, waffles, quiches, and hot (e.g., oatmeal, grits, farina) and cold cereals (there are hundreds of options) are common.\n Some fast-food places offer breakfast burritos, typically scrambled eggs, cheese, and a “breakfast” meat wrapped in a tortilla. Some breakfast foods are appropriate for lunch, brunch (a combination of breakfast and lunch often featuring the breakfast foods and lunch foods), and even for dinner (because, why not?) and some dinner meats are now routinely served at breakfast, including kielbasa and ham. Steak and eggs is common.\n In other words, the picture is blurred and loses even more focus when vegetarian, vegan, and continental options are chosen.\n For a lot of time-pressed Americans rushing to work, leftover Chinese, pizza, or fried chicken makes a meal. For others, it’s a V-8 and an apple or banana. Sometimes, a coffee and a breakfast sandwich rom a drive-through, or a doughnut (or two, or a toasted bagel with cream cheese works.\n In a society that is always awake, things like this are massively flexible.\n"

    "question": "What is forge welding?",
    "answer": "It is the ancient process of repeatedly heating, folding, and binding steel back to itself.\n The steel must be worked very hot - almost white hot.\n For reference, the coals in your campfire are usually cherry red at the low end and bright orange at the high end. This temperature range falls around 1000 degrees.\n Add an additional 1000 degrees and you’re approaching the proper forge welding temperature.\n Once the temperature is reached, the steel is folded over and tacked.\n It goes back into the forge for more heat. Then the flux is added.\n This will bind the steel together, acting as a glue.\n This is where the heavy, controlled hitting comes in.\n By hammering the steel together with a decent amount of force, you’re pressing it to itself and encouraging a chemical binding to take place.\n Why We Do It\n Forge welding developed as a way to strengthen otherwise lower grade steels. By combining low carbon steel with some high carbon steel and folding it repeatedly, the steel gains durability while retaining ductility (resilience).\n"

    "question": "Is it okay to leave a dead fish in an aquarium?",
    "answer": "It all depends on the size of the tank, the size of the fish and the filtering capacity of the system. A small fish in a large tank with heavy filtration may not cause any problem. If the tank has many scavengers they may eat the dead fish which may also prevent any problems from happening.\n Leaving a dead fish in the aquarium is much like overfeeding the fish. You put in excess organic matter that begins to decay. If this exceeds the filter’s capacity to break down nitrogenous waste you could have an ammonia spike or get cloudy water. This adds stress to the remaining fish. The larger the fish compared to the aquarium the more likely you will have a problem. Removing the dead fish is comparable to removing excess food if you overfeed. There is rarely a good reason not to remove a dead fish if you see it.\n If the fish is recently dead, it is always a good idea to examine the fish to see if the cause of death is obvious. You do not need to do a full blown necropsy, but if you detect a few ich spots on the fish, for example, you may be able to treat the tank before it becomes serious enough to threaten the remaining fish.\n"

    "question": "How can we find stocks for swing trading and positional trading?",
    "answer": "Finding stocks for swing trading and positional trading involves a combination of fundamental and technical analysis. Here are some steps to help you identify potential stocks for these trading strategies:Define your trading strategy: Determine your preferred time frame, risk tolerance, and trading objectives. Swing trading involves holding stocks for a few days to weeks, while positional trading involves holding stocks for several weeks to months.\n Use fundamental analysis: Conduct research on companies to identify those with strong fundamentals. Look for companies with solid financials, a competitive advantage, strong management, and positive industry outlook. Key factors to consider include earnings growth, revenue growth, profitability, debt levels, and industry trends.\n Screen for technical indicators: Apply technical analysis techniques to identify stocks with favorable price patterns and trends. Some common technical indicators used for swing trading and positional trading include moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), stochastic oscillators, and Bollinger Bands. Look for stocks with clear chart patterns, such as breakouts, reversals, or trends.\n Scan for catalysts: Identify potential catalysts that could drive stock price movements. Catalysts can include earnings announcements, product launches, regulatory approvals, industry news, or economic events. News sources, financial websites, and earnings calendars can help you stay informed about upcoming events.\n Monitor volume and liquidity: Ensure that the stocks you select have sufficient trading volume and liquidity. Higher trading volume ensures smoother execution of trades and tighter bid-ask spreads, reducing the impact of slippage.\n Evaluate risk-reward ratios: Assess the potential risk and reward of each trade. Determine an appropriate stop-loss level to limit losses and establish a target price or exit strategy to capture profits. Ideally, you should seek trades with a favorable risk-reward ratio, where potential gains outweigh potential losses.\n Backtest and analyze historical data: Validate your trading strategy by backtesting it against historical stock price data. This process helps you assess the performance of your strategy under different market conditions. Analyze the results and make any necessary adjustments to your strategy.\n Stay informed and adapt: Continuously monitor the stocks in your portfolio and stay updated on market trends, news, and company-specific developments. Adjust your positions as needed based on changing market conditions.\n"

About 50 mil doses are announced to be read. The pre-production has started BEFORE the FDA approval, which is highly unlikely and rare.\n To Two: Pfizer is a partner, and only does the production and distribution of the vaccine. It was developed by the German company “Biontech”. Which was founded by German Turks, a married couple who came to Germany as children. The father of the male part worked at the assembly line at Ford-Germany in Cologne. American Dream the German version.\n And THEY did the announcement of the vaccine. Pfizer was taken by surprise as much as anybody else.\n The German government gave research money to the Company, neither Pfizer nor Biontech saw as much as a single Cent from The Orange One.\n Knowing The Great Pretender and probably fearing that He-Who-Lies would take the credit for himself and telling the world he personally had come up with this fantastic stuff there is a chance that they really did wait for that announcement until AFTER “the cracker was eaten”. Nobody would have liked to have their success stolen by Mango Unhinged.\n But as it looks it was very much right in time after all things were set and no risk left to make that announcement.\n"

    "answer": "Yes, Donovan Mitchell (at 6-foot-1) is the shortest to do it.\nBut here are the 6 other players to ever score 70 in NBA history.\n1) Wilt Chamberlain (7-foot-1)\n His 100-point game still stands as the NBA record.\n But Wilt has scored 70+ a total of 6 times in his career.\n Which is insane.\n2) Kobe Bryant (6-foot-6)\n Kobe’s iconic 81 in 2006 stands as the 2nd-highest scoring game in NBA history.\n3) David Thompson (6-foot-4)\n Thompson dropped 73 in the last game of the ‘77–78 season, to try to get the scoring title.\n But in heartbreaking fashion, George Gervin scored 63 a few hours later.\n Giving Gervin the scoring title, edging out Thompson by a mere 0.2 PPG.\n4) David Robinson (7-foot-1)\n A similar thing happened 16 years later, in 1994.\n Robinson dropped 71 in the last game of the season, to win the scoring title over Shaq.\n But the Spurs did have to intentionally foul late in the game - even when up by 20 - to give Robinson some extra possessions.\n They REALLY wanted that scoring title over Shaq.\n5) Elgin Baylor (6-foot-5)\n In 1960 (before Wilt even scored 100), Baylor scored 71 points on 58% from the field.\n And added 25 rebounds for good measure.\n6) Devin Booker (6-fot-5)\n Before Mitchell, the most recent 70-point game was Devin Booker in 2017.\n And like David Robinson and the Spurs, the Suns were also intentionally fouling late in the game - just to get Booker to 70.\nBut to answer the initial question:\n Yes, Donovan Mitchell - at 6-foot-1 - is the shortest player ever to drop 70.\n"

    "question": "How much does centrifugal force generated by the earth's rotation affect an object's weight?",
    "answer": "Just to add a bit to the excellent answer already given, you can work this out algebraically by combining the formulas for centripetal acceleration [math]\\frac{v^2}{r}[/math] and Newton's second law, [math]F = ma[/math], to get a good approximation (approximate because we're assuming a perfectly spherical and gravitationally symmetric Earth).\n Here's how:\n 1. Find the tangential velocity at the equator: \n The Earth's radius is about [math]6.3\\cdot10^6 m[/math], and the Earth rotates [math]2\\pi rad[/math] every 86164 seconds (one sidereal day). Therefore, tangential velocity is:\n [math]\\dfrac{distance}{time} \\Rightarrow \\dfrac{2\\pi\\cdot6.3\\cdot10^6}{86164} \\approx 464 m/s[/math].\n 2. Now that you have velocity, use [math]\\frac{v^2}{r}[/math] to get centripetal acceleration:\n  [math]\\dfrac{464^2}{6.3\\cdot10^6} \\approx 0.034 m/s^2[/math].\n 3. Multiply the centripetal acceleration by [math]-1\\cdot[/math](your mass) to get the centrifugal force on your body (the -1 is because centrifugal force is in the opposite direction as centripetal force). For example, if you weigh 70kg then the centrifugal force is about\n [math]-70kg\\cdot0.034 m/s^2 = -2.38 Newtons[/math]\n 4. Divide Newtons by [math]9.8 m/s^2[/math] (acceleration rate of gravity) to get the difference in weight at the equator vs the poles: \n [math]\\dfrac{-2.38 N}{9.8 m/s^2} = -0.243kg[/math] (about 0.3 percent).\n To find the weight difference at a location other than the equator, just multiply the acceleration (464 m/s) by the cosine of your latitude. For myself, at about 45 degrees north, this calculation gives:\n [math]-70\\cdot\\frac{(464\\cdot\\cos(45))^2}{6.3\\cdot10^6} \\approx -1.19 N[/math], which is a weight difference of just under 0.2 percent.\n"

    "question": "Where do you find the crowd for crowdfunding campaigns?",
    "answer": "If you offer a highly-desirable product/service at a widely-acceptable price, then the crowd will find you to some extent, but it’s best not to rely upon “organic” traffic alone. It’s much better to reach out to the best audiences and invite them to come view your campaign page, which is the purpose of marketing.\n Pre-launch marketing may include social-media ads to generate e-mail leads, building an active social-media community of fans (who can provide you with great feedback although they may be harder to mobilize), pre-launch public relations, and preparing to mobilize your personal contacts.\n Post-launch marketing may include social-media advertisements (especially on Facebook), cross-promotions, affiliate marketing, and public relations (which may include paid editorials and/or social-media influencers). In our experience, these techniques normally yield the most pledges in this order—and more pledges from one source generally encourage more pledges from ALL sources. You can also try social-media posts but, in our experience, you shouldn’t expect any significant pledges from them unless you pay to boost them to the right audiences.\n"

    "question": "What's the relationship between ancient Macedonia and Greece? Are Macedonians Greek (not North Macedonia)?",
    "answer": "Absolutely none. The two entities are over 3000 years apart and there is absolutely no relation between them.\n There was no such thing as Ancient Greece. This is a modern technical term used by historians to better group historical periods in spatial terms. Outside of historical books it has absolutely no real meaning, because the region called Greece, actually Hellas, was a very loose concept with no real boundaries and no political meaning.\n There was no such thing as “Hellenic world\" either. This too is a modern technical term used by researchers to better organize cultural phenomena with spatial terms. Outside of the fields of study, this term has absolutely no real meaning because it has never really existed.\n The ancient people did not live in nation states with clear cut boundaries. Up until very recently, people in the Balkans lived in highly mixed areas. In the region called Macedonia lived all sorts of people, including Ancient Hellenes, Illyrians and Thracians.\n Logic dictates that Macedonians were a mixed bunch. Among them, Hellenes. Not the Athenian or Spartan kind. The shepherd kind. Goat herders. Peasants.\n"

    "question": "What are the worst things about corporate culture?",
    "answer": "One common criticism of corporate culture is that it can be too focused on profits and shareholder value at the expense of employee well-being and work-life balance. In some cases, this can lead to a toxic work environment where employees feel undervalued, overworked, and burned out.\n Another criticism is that corporate culture can be overly bureaucratic, hierarchical, and slow to adapt to change. This can make it difficult for employees to innovate, take risks, and make decisions quickly, which can stifle creativity and progress.\n Some people also criticize corporate culture for being too focused on competition and individual achievement, which can lead to a lack of collaboration, trust, and teamwork among employees.\n It's important to note that not all corporations have the same culture, and there are many companies that prioritize employee well-being, innovation, and collaboration. However, it's essential for companies to be aware of these common criticisms and work to create a positive and supportive work environment for their employees.\nVisit our website, [LINKED_TEXT: www.corporategifting.pk] [URL: http://www.corporategifting.pk/], to explore our extensive collection of corporate gifts suitable for your employees and clients.

    "answer": "Video games from the 90s were made using a variety of software tools and programming languages, depending on the platform and genre of the game. Some of the most popular platforms for video games in the 90s were PC, Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, PlayStation and Nintendo 64. Each platform had its own specifications and limitations that influenced the game development process.\n Some of the software tools that were used by video game developers in the 90s included:\n - Game engines: These are frameworks that provide basic functionalities such as graphics rendering, physics simulation, sound effects, user interface and input handling. Some of the most influential game engines of the 90s were id Tech (used for Doom and Quake), Unreal Engine (used for Unreal) and Build Engine (used for Duke Nukem 3D).\n - Programming languages: These are languages that allow developers to write instructions for how the game should behave. Some of the most common programming languages used for video games in the 90s were C (used for Doom, Quake and Super Mario Kart), C++ (used for Unreal), Assembly (used for Wolfenstein 3D) and BASIC (used for Lemmings).\n - Graphics software: These are programs that allow developers to create and edit images, sprites, textures, models and animations for their games. Some of the most popular graphics software used for video games in the 90s were Photoshop (used for Myst), Deluxe Paint (used for Monkey Island 2) and Autodesk 3D Studio Max (used for Tomb Raider).\n - Sound software: These are programs that allow developers to create and edit sounds, music and voiceovers for their games. Some of the most widely used sound software used for video games in the 90s were Pro Tools (used for Resident Evil), MIDI sequencers (used for Sim City 2000) and MOD trackers (used for Warcraft: Orcs & Humans).\n"

    "answer": "Because we all want cheap goods and African gov’ts set less ownerous safety, Human rights and environmental requirements for mining.\n Instead of having ubiqitous internet and cheap smart phones you would be complaining about how “information” is for the rich and how it so unfair that technology and goods are so expensive. The elements for these items already came from Africa, and many of them mined by children or funded conflict and human rights abuses. You didn’t complain then, but at least you take the word of the fossil fuel industry about the amount of environmental damage done by these evil EVs.\n That said every country is opening up Lithium and other battery materials mines, these are very common materials, its just that planning appications take longer and cost more in regulated/fairer countries. Still for a large mine you need a large less populated, less industrious country.\n Maybe you should work on thinking more for yourself than jumping on a bandwagon advertised by someone with an agenda that is already doing you alot of harm. Mines for materials we can use forever do alot less harm than mining materials for their energy value and using them once.\n"

The Vedas are the collection of the Knowlege Revealed to Rishis over several generations in Satya Yuga [In the tradition we call them apauruSheya granthas (texts having no human source. This idea is a fundamental standard of Sanatana Dharma). In Dwapara Yuga Veda Vyasa came in and Classified The Vedas into FOUR so that in the coming Kaliyga when memory and time of existence of people would be short, the task of preserving The Vedas could be divided among many.Shiva finds obeisance made to Him in The Rudra PrashnaH in the TaittirIya saMhitA as well as the VajasaneyI saMhita of the Shukla YajurVeda. And then there are several passages in the other Vedic saMhitas and Upanishads. The Vedic Devata system is different from what could be gathered from The Puranas. The Puranas are the simplified Scripture which Veda Vyasa authored Himself to help all classes of people. In this collection there is the Linga Purana and the Shiva maha Purana dedicated to Shiva.\nThe Shiva of The Vedas is Formless hence you would not be able to make out it is Shiva to whom the hymns are being sung.\n"

    "question": "Is tempered glass fragile?",
    "answer": "Tempered glass is a type of safety glass that is designed to be stronger and more resistant to breaking than regular glass. It is created by heating the glass to a very high temperature and then rapidly cooling it, which causes the glass to become stronger and more durable.\n While [LINKED_TEXT: tempered glass] [URL: https://parts4cells.com/tempered-glass.html] is generally more resistant to breaking than regular glass, it is still possible for it to break under certain circumstances. For example, tempered glass can break if it is subjected to a strong impact or if it is scratched or chipped. It can also break if it is exposed to extreme temperature changes, such as sudden heating or cooling.\n However, in general, tempered glass is considered to be much stronger and more durable than regular glass, and it is often used in applications where safety and durability are important, such as in automobile windows, shower doors, and mobile phone screens.\n Tempered glass is designed to break in a way that is less dangerous than regular glass. When tempered glass does break, it shatters into small, rounded pieces rather than sharp, jagged shards. This can help to reduce the risk of injury in the event of a breakage.\n Tempered glass is also more resistant to thermal stress than regular glass. This means that it can withstand sudden changes in temperature without breaking, which makes it a popular choice for oven doors, microwave windows, and other applications where exposure to heat is a concern.\n It's important to note that tempered glass is not completely indestructible and can still be damaged or broken under certain conditions. For example, tempered glass can be vulnerable to damage if it is subjected to extreme force or pressure, such as if it is dropped from a great height. It's also possible for tempered glass to break if it is exposed to certain chemicals or other substances.\n In summary, tempered glass is a durable and strong type of glass that is designed to be more resistant to breaking than regular glass. However, it's important to handle tempered glass carefully and to avoid exposing it to conditions that could cause damage or breakage.\n"

    "question": "What is the reason Jio loses 1.9 cr subscribers in September as Airtel continues to gain?",
    "answer": "Reliance Jio lost over 19 million wireless subscribers in September, dragging its gross user base down to 424.83 million, reflecting the massive clean-up of low-paying customers or removal of dormant users recently undertaken by Jio in the fiscal’s second quarter.\n As per Kiran Thomas, Reliance Jio's president, on the last earnings call:\n\"During the peak of the 2nd wave [of COVID-19, during the April-to-May timeframe], we had done a lot of initiatives … giving free voice minutes to keep them on our network, but 2 quarters later, we find that a large number of people at the bottom of the pyramid have not been able to stay up-to-date with recharges.\"\nThe story of inactive subscribers\n Jio's database has continued to feature a high number of inactive subscribers who are typically removed after 90 days only.\n The low tariffs at Jio's launch persuaded many consumers to adopt Jio as a second SIM, a phenomenon that continued even when Jio launched its JioPhone in 2019.\n It is one of the key reasons, Jio continues to have a lower number of active subscribers on its network than its rivals claim. Airtel has 97.86% of its users as active, while Vi has 87.31% and Jio, only has 83.65%.\n The reason for Jio's high number of inactive subscribers is the company's policy of not terminating service even after their plans expire, who are typically removed only after 90 days. Users can continue to receive incoming calls even when they have not recharged. This is not the case with other telcos like Airtel and Vi.\n Source: [LINKED_TEXT: Reliance Jio lost 19M users in September | Light Reading] [URL: https://www.lightreading.com/4g3gwifi/reliance-jio-lost-19m-users-in-september/d/d-id/773730]\n"

    "question": "What's better, Alibaba or Amazon?",
    "answer": "Taking all the angles it is pretty clear that Ali has pulled ahead of Amazon. Ali is a growing e-commerce website in the world and has already dominated many markets. It offers both wholesale for companies and retail for consumers across many different platforms. Alipay is already expanding into the global market where Amazon has no rival to meet it. (There is no Amazon pay app) Amazon came up with the idea for Amazon Go but has not figured out how to make it work yet. Ali already has a store that does what Amazon Go was supposed to do and it is up and running right now.\n Amazon might be about half of the ecommerce in the US but ecommerce in the US is only about 10% of sales each year. Alibaba has a little more than half of the ecommerce in China but ecommerce in China is at 40% of all sales in a year.\n Amazon has Prime that ships next day and sometimes it might arrive the same day. Ali and most of China’s ecommerce has same day delivery that can show up in as little as half an hour after the purchase. Next day delivery is the slow option over there.\n Finally Amazon does great on Black Friday and Cyber Monday there’s no question. But Ali invented China’s version of Black Friday and has dominated sales during the event ever since.\n"

    "question": "Why was Ezra able to save Ahsoka but not Kanan through time travel?",
    "answer": "It is because Ezra would have ceased to exist. Saving Kanan at that point of his death would have caused the entire main cast of Star Wars Rebels to die in the large fuel explosion because Kanan was holding the fire back in his last moments.\nAhsoka's situation was different, however. For example, if Ezra had grabbed Ahsoka at the point directly before she fought with Vader, then he would have died. Vader was about to strike him until Ahsoka intervened. Ahsoka's actual death was different because no major people were involved. She would have died alone, since everyone else had already escaped. Time Travel in Star Wars seems to work in a way where a direct change to any major event (such as preventing those from dying) completely changes everything that was related to that same event, even if the person who changed it was inside of a place like the World Between Worlds, which is unaffected by the traditional flow of time. Also, even if Ezra had tried to save Kanan, the portal was fake.\nHe was on the other side.\n - Kaseem\n"

    "question": "Why does 40 degree heat not cause travel problems in countries like Spain, but is forecasted to cause major problems in the UK?",
    "answer": "Because great parts of Spain are naturally and regularly hot - when it gets hot in Spain, it gets hot and for a long time - national infrastructure is built from the ground up to expect and deal with it.\n The UK ordinarily has a more temperate climate, with the number of really hot days per year often countable on the fingers of one hand. They’re an abberation, not normality.\n We’re not set up for this.\n Our national infrastructure is built for what our natural climate provides us 99.9% of the time. On Tuesday, the temperature is forecast to go as high as 41 degrees; but the days after it’s 27, 26, 23 - perfectly normal UK summer temperatures. Most people don’t have air conditioning because it’s not financially worthwhile to get it for the four or five days in a year you’ll use it. Our houses are consistently designed with cooler weather in mind, not warmer weather.\n How do you think Madrid, Khartoum, or Phoenix would cope if the temperature suddenly plunged and they had three feet of snow overnight?\n How about Nunavut, Denali, or Verkhoyansk if temperatures suddenly skyrocketed, and out came the blazing sunshine?\nAs global warming continues to affect us, this might need rethinking - but even now, days like today and tomorrow are few and far between.\n"

Why?\nMany slopes are steeper with almost vertical cliffs and escarpments in the Western Ghats and Nilgiris.Mechanical weathering due to temperature changes and ranges is pronounced.They receive heavy amounts of rainfall over short periods. So, there is almost direct rock fall quite frequently in these places along with landslides and debris avalanches.\n"

    "answer": "Q: Why don’t humans land in an asteroid or meteor and use it to travel further into space? We could use it to go to places like Mars.\n A couple of points.\nThey are not like buses, running a regular route. While they are in orbits, an asteroid for instance that passes Earth’s orbit is moving about the speed of Earth at that moment. So will only return about 1 per year.To catch and get on the bus, oops asteroid, unlike buses, they don’t stop, they don’t even pause, they just keeping moving along. So a craft that wanted to hitchhike (as it were) would have to match speeds before it could land (land!) and would thus be in the same orbit as the asteroid and going wherever the asteroid was, which makes one wonder that if, if you can match the speed of the asteroid why not just go where you want to go and cut out the middleman?Land! Asteroids have so little mass, that few of them have been able to have their gravity make spheroids of themselves. Their surface gravity is so low that landing is more of a bouncing.\nThere has been serious consideration of establishing (once needed) a shuttle service that could go between Mars and Earth using a controlled swing at each end to reverse the direction and sent the shuttle back the other way.\n"

    "question": "What makes Japanese block printing so special?",
    "answer": "In part it’s the immediacy of emotion which the blocks of color make possible in an art form which has some things in common with the 20th century art of comics.\n Yet this is combined with a subtlety in the expression of emotion in the texture of the paper and various advanced techniques of papermaking, printing, and burnishing the surface of the finished print. Photographs don’t remotely do this justice.\n The tension between the direct communication of the color and the subtlety of the paper is striking in the best work.\n Here’s a favorite of mine, a c. 1760s print by Harunobu—Courtesan on Veranda. In this case the elements of the effect mentioned above are reversed. The colloquial, folk quality of directness is conveyed not by color but by the shadows of the lively geisha party going on behind the central figure. And the color block effects are used to convey, through contrast, the pensive look of the woman who has stepped outside for a moment, perhaps to contemplate the melancholy nature of her trade.\n Japanese prints are a world unto themselves.\n"

    "question": "What is refueling in nuclear reactors?",
    "answer": "Below is a picture of a nuclear fuel bundle, a bundle of special pipes, and each individual pipe is filled with the little pellets of enriched uranium shown on the lower left. The bundle also contains some cadmium rods that are used to control the reactor temperature. The reactor works by splitting the atoms of these uranium pellets, but after a while these pellet filled rods need to be replaced with more-lively pellets. So, the spent rods are removed from the reactors and new bundles are put in and the reactor goes back to work. But that’s where the work really begins, in what is done with the spent bundle and that’s a very complicated/advanced process called reprocessing.\n Each rod has to be very carefully handled and emptied of the pellets, because in the fission process lots on new materials have been created in these pellets/rods. These new materials include Plutonium and other very dangerous and radioactive materials that need to be separated out. Some of these separated materials can be used for nuclear medicine, some for weapons, some for research, and some must go into a safe storage area. But most of the materials are repackaged and recycled and combined with fresh enriched uranium and are put back into the rods and used again to fire up the reactors.\n"

    "question": "Can universal moral values be established?",
    "answer": "Probably. However, just because a universal metric for morality can be devised doesn’t mean that it would be generally accepted or all that useful. It wouldn’t necessarily be exactly universal either. Even with a universal metric, what is or is not moral very well could be defined based on the environment.\n One way to define morality in a somewhat universal way is to define it in terms of how it effects the survivability of the population that expresses a given moral code. Essentially, we could define an action as moral if it results in an increase in evolutionary fitness of the group, and define it as immoral if it reduces the evolutionary fitness of the group.\n In the long run, moral codes do end up being selected in this way, as do many cultural elements. Cultural patterns that are advantageous, such as washing of one’s hands, will persist, while others will die out. It’s one reason why looking into folk beliefs can actually be rather useful. Even though they evolved randomly, a highly persistent folk tradition likely suggests that it had some benefit for the people who followed it.\n"

    "question": "Why does cancer relapse?",
    "answer": "One example:\n Cancer cells are supposed to self destruct. There a are chemical feedback loops which monitor activity of critical pathways and if they go out of bounds a protein is made in the nucleus which should trigger apoptosis. The cancer adapts by tagging that protein for destruction in a proteasome so the apoptosis pathway is never started. The chemo drug Bortizumib blocks the proteasome so the protein makes it out of the nucleus and induces apoptosis.\n There are many such pathways. This is why cancer is so adaptable. A new hope is possible because there is one enzyme, a kinase, that modulates up to 100 of these pathways. The hope is if you inhibit that one kinase you severely limit the adaptability of the cancer. Then if you toss in a general stressor like Cisplatin the cell will not adapt as it normally would. The kinase everyone is studying is named GSK3beta. The race is on for drug companies to find a safe, and powerful inhibitor of GSK3.\n Ironically there are already pretty good inhibitors but they are off patent. Indeed, the OTC drugs Cimetidine and Famotidine are powerful inhibitors of GSK3. 5 grams per day Cimetidine and 1 Gram per day Famotidine evenly spaced should work well. You might ask your oncologist about this.\n"

    "question": "Why do catholic priests contradict what Francis and Benedict say in public? How can you simultaneously retain possession of Universalism heresy while also teaching the exact opposite in Vatican II and China?",
    "answer": "The Catholic Church is a large and diverse institution, and it is not uncommon for different members of the clergy to hold differing views or interpretations of Church teachings. This can sometimes lead to contradictory statements being made, even by high-ranking members of the clergy like Pope Francis or Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI.\n It is also worth noting that Pope Francis and Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI come from different cultural and theological backgrounds, and their views and priorities may reflect these differences. For example, Pope Francis has placed a strong emphasis on social justice and the need to address poverty and inequality, while Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI is known for his strong defence of traditional Catholic doctrine and his opposition to certain aspects of secularism.\n Regarding Universalism heresy and Vatican II, the Catholic Church has undergone significant changes over the course of its history, and different members of the clergy may have differing interpretations of these changes and their implications. For example, Vatican II was a landmark event in the history of the Catholic Church that marked a significant shift in the Church's approach to ecumenism and interfaith relations, and some members of the clergy may have interpreted these changes in different ways.\n Regarding China, the Catholic Church has a complex relationship with the Chinese government, and different members of the clergy may have different views on how best to navigate this relationship. Some members of the clergy may believe that the Church should take a more conciliatory approach to the Chinese government in order to protect the interests of the Catholic community in China, while others may believe that the Church should take a more confrontational approach in order to defend the rights of Catholics and other persecuted religious groups in China.\n In conclusion, the Catholic Church is a complex and diverse institution, and it is not surprising that different members of the clergy may hold different views or interpretations of Church teachings and practices.\n"

    "question": "How did flour mills work in the olden days?",
    "answer": "Flour mills in the olden days were powered by either wind, water, or animal power. The basic function of a flour mill was to grind wheat or other grains into flour, which was then used for baking or other purposes.\n In a water-powered flour mill, a stream of water was used to turn a large waterwheel. The waterwheel was connected to a series of gears and pulleys that turned the millstones, which were used to grind the grains into flour. The millstones were made of either granite or sandstone and were stacked on top of each other, with the grooves on the top stone matching the furrows on the bottom stone. The grains were poured into the center of the top millstone, and the pressure and friction from the grinding process produced the flour.\n Wind-powered flour mills used a similar process, with a large windmill replacing the waterwheel. The windmill turned a shaft that was connected to the millstones, and the grinding process was the same as in a water-powered flour mill.\n Animal-powered flour mills, on the other hand, used animals such as horses, mules, or oxen to power the millstones. The animals would walk in a circle around the mill, pulling a heavy wooden arm that was connected to the millstones. The grinding process was the same as in a water or wind-powered mill.\n Flour mills played an important role in early societies, providing a way to process grains into flour that could be used for food and other purposes. The development of more efficient and mechanized flour mills in the industrial era led to an increase in the production of flour and other grain products.\n"

For example, a player with very little processing power may play WAV files more smoothly; but a device with a very slow network connection may experience fewer problems with a FLAC file because, even though it requires more processing power to decode, requires less bandwidth to transfer between devices.Some devices or programs may not support one or the other at all. WAV is a more universal format, and almost all audio software and player devices support it; FLAC is a free and open source format, which is also supported by most devices - OTHER THAN APPLE DEVICES. Apple prefers their own proprietary formats, so many Apple computers, and many player programs that run on them, will handle WAV files, but won’t play FLAC files, or may require an extra add-on to do so.\n"

    "question": "Which do you prefer, dubbed movies or subtitled movies?",
    "answer": "For those who appreciate film as a form of art, dubbing is absolutely out of the question.\n Major part of actor’s performance is in his voice. They take great pains at delivering their lines with the emotional charge in their voice. You could watch a good movie with the image turned off and still get a significantly greater emotional response than watching the picture with the sound turned off. Someone said a film without sound is simply surveillance.\n So, if you don’t understand the language of the film, subtitles will help you understand the dialogue. But having it dubbed by some no-name actor essentially removes almost half of the original artistic value of the movie. People like Mat Damon, or Kate Winslet, or Dustin Hoffman get paid large sums of money to provide their voices for animated films. The entirety of their performance is in their spoken dialogue. To have their voices overdubbed by some no-name actors essentially completely obliterates all of the value these highly paid actors brought to the film.\n"

    "question": "What is sprint planning?",
    "answer": "In particular, there are four events that you will encounter during the scrum process.\n Sprint – A scrum sprint basically is a specified time period during which a Scrum Team produces a product. It forces prioritization, demonstrates progress, avoids unnecessary perfections, motivates closure, improves predictability and improves the return of investment.\n The four events or ceremonies of Scrum Framework are:\nSprint Planning\n It is a meeting where the work to be done during a sprint is mapped out and the team members. During this meeting, the entire team clearly defines deliverables for the Sprint and assigns the work necessary to achieve that goal. It is an event where you can get answers to the following questions:\n What can be delivered in this Sprint iteration?\n The development team decides on the functionality to be worked upon during the sprint duration. The product owner modifies product backlog accordingly and discusses the project target that a Sprint should achieve. Entire scrum team takes part in Sprint Planning to understand the work or tasks to be performed in that Sprint and create a sprint goal.\n How to achieve that work?\n Once the entire team agrees on the product backlog items and sets the Sprint goal, the development team starts developing the functionality. It does so by designing the system and the work needed to convert the Product Backlog into a working product Increment. By the end of sprint planning, the development team should be able to explain how it is going to accomplish the Sprint Goal.\n To know more about other events of the scrum, refer to this article - [LINKED_TEXT: Agile Scrum Tutorial] [URL: https://www.edureka.co/blog/agile-scrum-tutorial/]\n"

    "question": "What are some possible causes of sciatica and lower back pain?",
    "answer": "Sciatica and low back pain can have a variety of underlying causes, and it is essential to identify these factors to determine the most effective treatment method. Here are some prevalent causes:\n Herniated Disc: This condition occurs when the soft interior portion of a spinal disc protrudes through the outer layer, resulting in nerve compression. It may cause lower back pain and sciatica symptoms.\n Spinal Stenosis refers to the narrowing of the spinal canal, which can cause spinal chord and nerve compression. This compression can cause lower back pain and sciatica, particularly during standing and walking.\n Degenerative Disc Disease: As we age, the vertebral discs can gradually degenerate and lose their capacity to provide cushioning. When the discs become thinner and the vertebrae begin to rub against one another, this condition can cause lower back discomfort.\n Overexertion, improperly lifting large objects, and sudden movements can strain the muscles and ligaments in the lower back. This stress may cause lower back discomfort that radiates to the buttocks and legs.\n Spondylolisthesis occurs when a vertebra slides out of proper alignment, typically as a result of a stress fracture. If the displaced vertebra compresses the nerve origins, it can result in low back pain and sciatica.\n Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis can cause inflammation, stiffness, and lower back discomfort in the spine.\n If you are experiencing persistent lower back pain or sciatica, it is recommended that you follow [LINKED_TEXT: this sureshot way to cure sciatica] [URL: https://rogersunderstandingsciatica.quora.com/How-have-you-cured-your-sciatica-pain].\n"

    "question": "Why do console games still get physical releases but PC games don't?",
    "answer": "There are a few factors that explain why PC games no longer have physical releases yet console games do.\nRetail sales: A significant amount of console game sales still occur in physical retail locations. For example, people purchase video games in physical shops as presents for their kids. Additionally, because physical console games are often more costly than their digital counterparts, stores may charge more for them.Convenience: Installing physical console games is simpler than installing digital ones. The game will immediately begin installing on the console when you insert the disc. A huge file must often be downloaded in order to play digital games, which might take a while on a sluggish internet connection.Collectors' market: There is a sizable market for physical console game collector's editions. These versions sometimes include bonus materials including miniatures, art books, and soundtracks.\nOn the other hand, the majority of PC games are now distributed digitally.\n The development of broadband internet, the ease of digital downloads, and the decreased cost of digital dissemination are a few reasons for this.\n Some PC games are still made available in physical form. These games are often intended for a more casual audience or are meant to be played offline.\n"

    "question": "What are the differences between a wireless and a wired connection?",
    "answer": "Wireless and wired networks both provide a means of connecting multiple devices to share data, but they differ in how the connection is established. A wired network uses physical cables to connect devices, such as [LINKED_TEXT: Ethernet cables] [URL: https://www.newyorkcables.com/], while a wireless network uses radio waves to transmit data between devices.\n One advantage of wired networks is that they are generally more secure than wireless networks since the physical cables prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, wired networks tend to be faster and more reliable than wireless networks since there is no interference from other radio signals.\n On the other hand, wireless networks provide greater flexibility and portability since they don't require any physical cables. This makes them ideal for use in places where it's not feasible or practical to run wires, such as outdoors or in large buildings with many floors. They also tend to be less expensive than wired networks due to the lack of cabling costs.\n"

    "question": "Why is the Molecule Man considered so powerful, given that there are lots of matter manipulators in the Marvel universe?",
    "answer": "Molecule Man once confronted the Enchantress and Loki, rendering their magical abilities completely neutralized. He created an impervious field so potent that it not only defied all attempts to break through it, but also negated their ability to cast spells. Remarkably, his abilities extended even to the Asgardian realm of magic, manipulating it with ease and this was before Doctor Doom ever unlocked his own powers when he stole the Beyonder’s powers. During the events of Secret Wars, the Enchantress dared to kidnap Molecule Man's girlfriend, only to quiver with fear when she saw him flying towards her, causing her to disappear in a flash.\n In another awe-inspiring feat, Molecule Man engaged in a fierce battle against Scarlet Witch, a nexus being with reality-warping powers, when he was under the manipulations of the demon Mephisto. Both combatants were equally matched, using their powers to counteract each other at every turn. However, Scarlet Witch eventually resorted to a clever ruse, creating an illusion that led Molecule Man to believe he had won. Once she had successfully gauged the distance between them, Scarlet Witch then used her powers to disrupt the connection between Molecule Man and the demon Mephisto, ending their conflict.\n"

    "question": "What is the suggested tilt angle of a photovoltaic solar panel?",
    "answer": "Point the panel at the sunlight each minute of the day. A two axis tracking system will give you the best solar performance. Ours uses a vertical axis spin and a roof mounted tilt to follow the sun in the sky based on data, not sensing. We know where the sun is going to be in the sky and the two axis tracker will point to where the sun is any minute in the day. The most valuable solar energy is at sundown and sunrise. If you mount your solar panels to the roof with no tracking that most valuable electricity will not be produced. The size of the night time battery bank is determined by the energy lull at night. If you can shrink the time between sundown and sunrise electric generation you can pay less money for your smaller battery bank. The cost of the tracker is somewhat offset by the requiring a smaller battery bank for the night. If you are bumming off the monopoly power grid and not buying your own night storage then the monopoly will figure out how to get your money to pay for their operations and profits even if you make your own electricity in the light hours. Going off grid for your vehicle is easy with advanced dual mode EVs coming. Taking your house off grid is a bit of a hat trick today but will be very common as the monopoly starts to squeeze the grid-tied systems for revenue in the future.

In return, he had an inside man. He hoped Sansa would be able to manipulate Ramsay, garnering Baelish more power in their esteem. If Stannis beat the Boltons, Sansa would be able to negotiate with him to be able to be returned as Wardeness of the North, Ramsay would be killed, and she’d be free to marry Baelish and make him Warden of the North.

By handing over Sansa, knowing there was a bounty for her, and the Boltons taking the gamble that Cersei wouldn’t send an army over it, the marriage completely undermined the Boltons’ status with the Crown and isolated them from all aid.

    "question": "Where can I find a loan shark fast?",
    "answer": "It is not advisable to seek out a loan shark. Loan sharks are illegal, and they often charge exorbitant interest rates and use intimidation tactics to collect on the loans they provide. They are not regulated by the government, which means that borrowers have little protection if something goes wrong. In many cases, borrowers fall into a cycle of debt and are unable to repay the loan and the excessive interest charged by loan sharks.\n Instead of seeking out a loan shark, you should consider other options for obtaining a loan, such as a bank, a credit union, or a reputable online lender. These institutions are regulated by the government and are required to follow certain laws and regulations to protect borrowers. They typically offer loans at much lower interest rates and have more favorable repayment terms.\n Also, you should be aware that if you are struggling with debt, there are several organizations that can help you manage and consolidate your debt, such as credit counseling agencies, debt management services, or debt consolidation companies.\n It is important to seek assistance from reputable and legitimate sources, not from illegal activities or loan sharks.\n"

Dont just think just pull your socks and start your preparatiom\n ● You are mature enough to understand the seriousness of prepartion. You are ready to throw urself for its prep and this age is optimum for starting. Now ain’t tym for asking when ,where and why.\n ● All you need is a genuine START. Then accelerate. Know your speed. Sustain the momentum. Always realize that the hours you waste today would cost you tomorrow. Once you realize that you are wasting time for no reason, you will start focusing on your goal. Realize it now.\n ●Some aspirants assume that they can give the exam next year by preparing very well this year. This feeling gets stronger as the Prelims approach. This is one of the reasons why only less than 50 per cent of applicants write Preliminary exam every year.\n Experts believe that aggressive preparation for 10 to 12 months is a must. Four out of every 10 Indians (21-32 years) aspire to become an IAS officer and competition is so intense that only 5 percent of that massive number gets through. An aspirant must map-out an effective strategy and decide ideal number of hours required to implement that strategy.\n An aspirant should also understand that preparation for civil services examination calls for qualitative and not quantitative preparation. It is about completion of your short term target. Ideally you should target two subjects every day. Most of the top rankers have started preparing for the exams right from their school days, as most of the questions are asked mostly from Class 6 to 12 standard books. So preparing notes and devoting 10 to 12 hours before a year of exam is believed to be sufficient.\n Find out the topics you are good at and the topics you would need help in.

In India, numerous Dravidian languages survived, as did a few isolates (many of which are now going extinct) like [LINKED_TEXT: Nihali] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihali_language], and some Austro-Asiatic languages like [LINKED_TEXT: Korku] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korku_language]. In Scandinavia, Finno-Saami languages are spoken natively in Finland and adjacent areas of Sweden and Norway. Within recorded history, we know [LINKED_TEXT: Etruscan] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_language] was spoken in Italy, and some non-Indo-European languages existed in the Greek aisles.\n The common explanation for why Basque remained, but the rest died off in Western Europe, is that Basque is spoken in a mountainous area which didn’t have heavy contact with the outside until after Roman times. However, this explanation does not explain why there is a dearth of non-Indo-European languages spoken in the Alps or the Scottish Highlands.\n One reality which many people don’t seem to understand is that languages often die out, while the speakers continue having descendants. That is—just because Etruscan, the Etruscan identity, and Etruscan culture have all gone extinct, that does not mean all Etruscans died. Etruscans had kids—at some point those kids started speaking Latin, and then their grandchildren only learned Latin.\n Genetic tests on modern areas of England in Leslie et al (2015) found:\n“[…] no evidence of a general “Celtic” population in non-Saxon parts of the UK. Instead there were many distinct genetic clusters in these regions, some amongst the most different in our analyses. Further, the ancestry profile of Cornwall (perhaps expected to resemble other “Celtic” clusters) is quite different from that of the Welsh clusters, and much closer to that of Devon, and Cent./ S England. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the Welsh clusters represent populations that are more similar to the early post-ice-age settlers of Britain than those from elsewhere in the UK.”\nThis implies that, at some point, different Pre-Indo-European hunter gatherer and agriculturalist populations started speaking Celtic languages, while in other areas the Celtic settlers became the demographic majority.\n Reference:\n Leslie, S., Winney, B., Hellenthal, G., Davison, D., Boumertit, A., Day, T., ... & Falush, D.

    "question": "What did people think about the reasons for the extinction of the dinosaurs until they found the meteorite?",
    "answer": "Problem is, it’s hard to do an autopsy on a fossil. especially if all the soft tissues are gone. One theory was that the fast intelligent mammals simply out-competed the pore, dumb dinosaurs. It simply never seems to happen that a new taxon evolves in place and drives an older one to extinction, because everything is fully adapted to its environment. Other theories included pandemics, climate change, or volcanic eruptions. The thing that got scientists so excited about the impact hypothesis is it was the sort of event that could leave actual physical evidence, and better yet, did. Other mass extinctions, like the Siberian Traps causing the Permian mass extinction, suffer from post hoc ergo propter hoc. The fact that two events are juxtaposed in time doesn’t automatically mean one caused the other. When you have a thin layer of impact debris smack at the Cretaceous-Paleogene* boundary, that’s pretty clear cut.\nSo why is it “Paleogene” now instead of “Tertiary?” Well, Tertiary is a relic of a time when the hard crystalline rocks were considered oldest and called “Primary,” hard bedded rocks were “Secondary,” soft bedded rocks were “Tertiary” and unconsolidated surface materials were “Quaternary.” The “Tertiary” was almost synonymous with the Cenozoic Era, which seemed kind of useless, so it was split into two eras. Paleogene comprises the Paleocene, Eocene and Oligocene epochs, and the Miocene and Pliocene are the Neogene. Pleistocene and Holocene make up the Quaternary.\n"

    "question": "How can you tell the difference between a baby snake and a worm?",
    "answer": "Differentiating between a [LINKED_TEXT: baby snake] [URL: https://ophiology.net/arabian-sand-boa/] and a worm can be challenging, especially since some baby snakes may resemble worms due to their small size and slender appearance. However, there are several key characteristics that can help you distinguish between the two:\n 1.Movement: Baby snakes typically move in a sinuous, serpentine manner, while worms move with a more continuous, smooth, and undulating motion. Snakes use their muscles to propel themselves forward, giving them a distinct slithering movement.\n 2. Segmentation: Worms, such as earthworms, are segmented creatures, and you can often see the clear division between their body segments. Snakes, even as babies, do not display such segmentation.\n 3. Eyes: Baby snakes have visible eyes, typically with round pupils, even though they may be small. In contrast, worms lack eyes altogether.\n 4. Body Scales: Baby snakes have scales covering their entire body, while worms lack scales entirely.\n 5. Head Shape: Baby snakes have a distinct head shape, which is wider and more defined than their body. Worms have a relatively uniform body without a clear differentiation between head and body.\n 6. Behavior: Baby snakes are predators and may exhibit predatory behavior, such as flicking their tongue to sense the environment and seeking potential prey. Worms, on the other hand, do not exhibit such behavior and primarily feed on decomposing organic matter.\n 7. Habitat: Baby snakes are often found in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, forests, and urban areas. Worms are commonly found in soil, compost, and decaying organic matter.\nIf you are uncertain about the identity of the creature you have encountered, it's best to observe it from a safe distance and avoid handling it. If you suspect it might be a baby snake and are unsure if it is venomous or non-venomous, it's essential to exercise caution and avoid any direct contact. When in doubt, it is always best to seek the assistance of a local wildlife expert or herpetologist who can properly identify the creature and handle it safely if necessary.\n Please upvote if it was helpful.\n"

But since you asked a different question then let's take that question… As soon as news of the attack reached the Pentagon, a task force would be assembled and a Megalodon training facility would be built. The new task force would then capture all the Megalodons it could find and bring them to the training facility in giant tanker ships to be trained to distinguish and attack Russian submarines while using negative reinforcement techniques to teach the Megalodon not to attack the American ones. The trained Megalodons would then be released, all the Russian submarines would be destroyed and the world would live in peace forever after, perhaps even the 70’s hippie peace culture would take hold again and the next US president would be chosen from a selection of peace-mongering Gurus.\n Here’s an artist's impression of the new President and Congress….\n"

    "answer": "The cost of liposuction in India can vary depending on several factors, including the geographic location of the clinic, the experience and qualifications of the surgeon, the extent of the procedure, and any additional fees associated with anesthesia, facility charges, and post-operative care.\n In general, liposuction costs in India can range from approximately INR 50,000 to INR 2,50,000 or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. It's important to note that the cost of the procedure should not be the primary factor in deciding on a surgeon or clinic, as the experience and qualifications of the surgeon and the quality of care provided are also crucial considerations.\n It's recommended to schedule a consultation with a qualified and experienced cosmetic surgeon to discuss your specific needs and goals, as well as the associated costs and potential risks of the procedure. The surgeon can provide a personalized quote based on your individual case and help you understand the factors that contribute to the cost of the procedure.\n"

For instance mass production high purity graphene.Improved computers in terms of software related topics.Cheap space freight shipping.Automation, robotics, AI, and various other forms of engineering.IAdvanced medical applications ranging from genetic cures to cybernetic prosthetics and longevity options.\nAll of these are slowly being worked on but have serious complications that take a while to completely solve. A lot of these are interrelated also. For instance improvement in computer hardware may require cheap and pure graphene, which in turn could also make lighter stronger space craft increasing space craft reuse so shipping material to space would become cheap. These tend to stack like this. In the next decade, if all goes well, these will all have strides made in their fields. There is a “science futurism” group that is like a mix of science fiction and non-fiction such that it follows the ways in which science fiction could come into existence using real science and engineering.

    "question": "How do I get my son to stop making music?",
    "answer": "If you're looking to discourage your son from making music, it's important to approach the situation with sensitivity and respect for his interests and passions. Instead of trying to completely stop him from pursuing his musical aspirations, consider having an open and honest conversation to better understand his motivations and explore potential compromises. Here are a few suggestions:\nCommunication: Talk to your son and express your concerns or reasons for wanting him to stop making music. It's important to listen to his perspective as well. Engage in a constructive dialogue to find common ground and understand each other's viewpoints.Encourage balance: Emphasize the importance of maintaining a balance between pursuing hobbies and responsibilities. Encourage him to dedicate time to his studies or other activities alongside his musical pursuits. Help him create a schedule that allows him to manage his time effectively.Set goals and milestones: Work with your son to establish measurable goals and milestones in his music journey. Encourage him to set targets for improvement, such as learning new techniques, writing original songs, or performing at local events. This approach can help him focus on making progress while also understanding the need for other commitments.Explore alternative outlets: If you have concerns about the impact of music on your son's academic or personal life, suggest exploring alternative ways to engage with music that may be less time-consuming or demanding. For example, he could join a music club or ensemble at school instead of pursuing individual music production.Supportive involvement: Show interest in your son's music by attending his performances, listening to his compositions, or offering constructive feedback. This demonstrates that you value his passion and talent while also maintaining an active role in his musical journey.Consider professional guidance: If you remain concerned about the impact of music on your son's future prospects, consider seeking advice from professionals such as career counselors, music teachers, or mentors who can provide an objective assessment of the situation and offer guidance on potential paths forward.\nRemember, it's important to respect your son's interests and passions. Instead of trying to stop him completely, it's often more effective to find ways to support and guide him towards a balanced approach that integrates his musical pursuits with other aspects of his life.\n"

    "question": "Why do waitresses ask if Coke is okay instead of Pepsi? Do you think it makes a big difference if you get Coke or Pepsi?",
    "answer": "Ofcourse, as Coke is better\n HCCB’s product portfolio includes Coca-Cola, one of the world’s favorite sparkling drinks. Coca-Cola is sold in more than 200 countries, has many firsts to its credit – the first product to appear on the cover of the TIME magazine; the first soft drink to be consumed in space; the first company to feature Santa in its advertising campaign. In fact, Coca-Cola is credited for establishing Santa as a pleasantly plump character painted in red with rosy cheeks, a white beard, twinkling eyes and laughter lines. Coca-Cola traces its origin to May 8, 1885, when John Pemberton, a pharmacist, created a distinctive tasting soft drink. The name Coca-Cola was given to the beverage because it contained extracts from the coca leaf and the kola nut. It was, however, Dr Pemberton's friend and business partner, Frank M Robinson, who came up with the name Coca‑Cola. He wrote it out by hand in the Spencerian script thinking the two Cs would look well in advertising. The company continues to use the same design as its logo. The famous contour bottle prototype, which became the standard bottle of Coca- Cola, was designed by Alexander Samuelson and patented by the Root Glass Company in 1915. Variants of Coca-Cola include low and no-sugar options such as Diet Coke and Coca- Cola No sugar.\n"

    "question": "How would you analyze condensing (gas to liquid) and boiling (liquid to gas) from the point of view of the first law of thermodynamics?",
    "answer": "Condensation is a exothermic process (it releases heat when it occurs) and boiling is endothermic (it absorbs heat when it occurs). Therefore, since there is an energy exchange in these processes, according to the first law this means that there is a change in the internal energy of the system. This change will be equal to the exchange occurred through heat and work. For condensation the work exchanged is negligible (since the change in volume between solid and liquid is very small, so unless the reaction occurs at very high pressures the work will also be very small), so you can determine that the difference in internal energy between the solid and the liquid is equal to the heat exchanged.\n For boiling it is more difficult, because you also need to take into account the work performed by the expansion of the liquid into a gas. This is why we normally don't worry about internal energy differences (which are difficult to measure) and use enthalpy changes instead. The change in enthalpy is (by definition) the heat exchanged in a process at constant pressure. Since almost all natural processes occur at constant pressure (the atmospheric pressure) you can easily determine the change in enthalpy by measuring the heat exchanged when the process occurs in an open container.\n"

    "answer": "When it comes to the great debate of alcohol versus marijuana, there are certainly pros and cons to consider. Let's dive in and explore each side in a casual manner.\n First up, alcohol. The pros of alcohol include its widespread availability and social acceptance. It's legal in most places, making it easily accessible. It's also a great way to unwind and let loose at parties or gatherings. Additionally, a drink or two can help some people relax and alleviate stress.\n But hold on, there are definitely some cons to consider as well. Alcohol can lead to excessive consumption and binge drinking, which can have serious health consequences. It impairs judgment and coordination, increasing the risk of accidents and poor decision-making. Not to mention the dreaded hangovers that can leave you feeling like a zombie the next day.\n Now, let's talk about marijuana. The pros of using marijuana include its potential medical benefits. It can offer relief from chronic pain, ease anxiety, and even help with nausea. Many people also find that it enhances their creativity and promotes relaxation. Plus, it's impossible to ignore the fact that it's gaining legal recognition in more and more places.\n But of course, there are cons to consider as well. Marijuana is still illegal in many parts of the world, which can lead to legal consequences for users. It can also have adverse effects on memory and cognition, especially when used excessively. Additionally, some people may experience anxiety or paranoia when using marijuana, which can be quite unpleasant.\n"

    "question": "How realistic is a Thorium based nuclear reactor?",
    "answer": "It’s as realistic as any nuclear reactor.\n But it doesn’t involve any easily weaponized material. It’s true that thorium reactors are inherently “breeder” reactors, and that causes confusion allowing some people to compare them to reactors that can breed plutonium from uranium. But the isotope of uranium bred by thorium reactors is too light to produce significant amounts of plutonium by further breeding, and the 233 isotope of uranium is far too radioactive for make separating any plutonium that may occur by excess breeding remotely feasible.\n At a larger scale, all nuclear reactors suffer this same popular confusion with Chernobyl and Fukushima. Once you say “nuclear reactor”, the discussion of relative merits is over for 99% of the population, all nukes are world destroying abominations in their view. Adding the term “breeder” in front doesn’t help.\n Of the tiny percentage of the population that is open to the ins and outs of nuclear power, a reactor that allows them to either produce plutonium or enriched uranium that could be further enriched to weapons-grade material is a major plus, one that is notably absent from the thorium reactor.\n While those who want nuclear reactors mainly for the production of weapons grade material are not really in the majority, they do form the most powerful and influential lobby in favor of nuclear power. So a reactor that doesn’t provide any feasible hope of obtaining weapons grade material by operating it has already lost over half the political support it might have for being a nuclear reactor, while not losing any of the massive political opposition which is based firmly on complete ignorance.\n So while a thorium reactor is technically superior in most ways, it is not less expensive to build and operate cause the main cost of nuclear reactors is overcoming political opposition, and they don’t have as much backing to overcome that, precisely because of how much inherently safer they are.\n"

    "question": "How do you imagine life in 100 years?",
    "answer": "In 100 years, one can envision a world where the confluence of mathematics, machine learning, and advanced technologies have redefined the fabric of daily life. Imagine cities that function like well-orchestrated symphonies, where transportation systems operate on advanced dynamical models, minimizing congestion and environmental impact. AI systems, fuelled by deep learning algorithms, manage civic infrastructure, continually adapting to emerging patterns and needs.\n Personalized healthcare becomes the norm, with predictive models offering personalized treatments based on an individual's genetic makeup, lifestyle, and real-time biometrics. Finance would also see a paradigm shift, with risk models that adapt to global economic fluctuations, capable of predicting and mitigating financial crises.\n Education, powered by interactive and adaptive learning platforms, allows for personalized learning experiences, breaking the barriers of geography and socio-economic status. Perhaps, most intriguingly, the integration of quantum computing and AI models could lead to breakthroughs in understanding and manipulating the fabric of reality itself.\n The ethical implications of such a world will be as complex and multifaceted as the technologies driving them, requiring ongoing dialogue and careful stewardship. The union of human creativity with advanced mathematical models and computational power could usher in an era of unprecedented innovation, prosperity, and interconnectedness, while also posing new challenges and ethical dilemmas that will require wisdom and foresight to navigate.\n This future, while optimistic, is not without its challenges. It presupposes a trajectory of technological development that prioritizes the common good and human well-being, rather than reinforcing existing inequities or leading to unforeseen negative consequences. The realization of such a future would likely depend on a combination of technological innovation, political will, ethical considerations, and perhaps even a bit of luck.\n"

    "question": "Why is intelligent design opposed by so many scientists?",
    "answer": "Because intelligence, life and consciousness is opposed by science as incomprehensible as science believes in a mechanical universe - clockwork earlier - and such fantasies as intelligence has no place in machinery. Science is the only source of truth in our society. So the truth is science. In 1900 Lord kelvin stated that everything had been discovered by science - in 1900 science knew all and everything about the universe. So why do the scientists study, matter, light, black holes, dark matter and so on, is it because science knows little about reality and hides behind higher, abstract mathematics which the very few understand and would then know the real truth, that the mathematical systems cannot be reconciled as science understands nothing of reality only the Mineral kingdom in Nature from which magically the “spark of life” appeared.\n So science, when boiled down to basics uses magic to explain its superstitions of reality. The Big bang came from pre-existing energy, which came from pre-existing energy, which came from pre-existing energy into infinity - magic in other words without a magician.\n Science bases its “thinking” upon the artificial thinking invented by Aristotle - although stating that all knowledge before 1840 was superstition, Aristotle lived a few thousand years before 1840 - “Academic” is defined as unrelated to reality and that is what the generalizing, abstract “thinking” of science is unrelated to reality.\n"

    "answer": "We have no government. Rather we have a set of incompetents whose primary aim is to devise ways to cling on to power. That power does not do us any good,?it may do to them. Whenever there is excess rainfall it goes to the sea. We don’t think of deepening the reservoirs except as a n after thought. If all the big waterbodies had been deepened substantially, we would be able to store enough water to last the dry periods. It is too much to expect the present non-government to do snything. People have to clean up their home water conservation systems, use less water, don’t use showers but use buckets, water their plants sparingly etc., But in the longer term these Rip Van Winkles have to wake up from their coma and take appropriate measures. Stealing river sand depletes ground water resources and it takes place everyday with official connivance. Is has been estimated if small and medium ponds are deepened we won’t have water scarcity and ground water will get recharged. But small water bodies have Ben encroached upon by local politically powerful. Water conserving crops should be encouraged - not sugar cane. We can always buy sugar from surplus states. Till we get good monsoons, swimming pools should be closed even if tourists in five star hotels are unhappy.\n"

    "question": "What exactly are Cyclops' optic blasts? Is it a particle beam? Is he firing protons?",
    "answer": "In the Marvel Universe, there’s been TWO definitions on what his power is.\n First up, the energy he sends out is a high energy discharge that only hit with pure kinetic force. With his visor, he can focus it into a pinpoint or a devastating wide beam.\n(Pinterest - If you only hurt the one you love, is this Cyclops self-loving?)\n As for where it comes from, there’s been TWO takes in the Marvel Universe where as the 1st, it was theorized that he was absorbing sunlight and surrounding energy around him into his optic blasts.\n However, this was later revised a few years later, and that’s the current basis of his powers. His eyes are no longer eyes per se, but are actually DIMENSIONAL PORTALS to a dimension that’s entirely out of energy.\n(from Pinterest, The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, Vol. 2)\n So this way, every time he opens his eyes, the dimension is breached and that energy pours through as a wave of pure crimson kinetic force.\n One interesting thing… in the past, there’s been a number of heroes and villains such as Darkstar, Cloak, The Shroud and such who have been able to access the “Darkforce Dimension” as their mutant or magical power as a means to teleport, project force and so on and has been used for quite a few interesting stories.\n So by corollary, what if this energy dimension Cyclops draws on happens to be inhabited, or is an extension of the Crimson dimension of Cyttorak?

    "question": "Is it unethical to tell an Alzheimer’s patient that they’re vacationing in an awesome place, rather than telling them they’re in a care facility—assuming they would take your word for it, feel happy, and not discover the lie?",
    "answer": "In our society, it is unethical to lie to someone. One reason is people need factual information to make decisions about their life. However, the person with alzheimers does not have the ability to process information and make rational decisions based on new information.\n The classic situation is the family that insists on orienting grandma to reality. If grandfather died years ago, each time she asks for him, and is informed that he is dead, you only provoke grief and sadness. What good does this reality orientation do the mental well being of your grandma, none whatsoever. It is far better to play along and say grandpa is still at work, or some other explanation that promotes calmness.\n The nurse at the local Alzheimers Association calls these fiblets, or therapeutic lies. You say what ever promotes calm and comfort for the person with Alzheimers.\n To tell the truth to someone with Alzheimers can be mentally cruel. As most people have answered, it is best to go with what the person believes. You do not need to invent a different scenario.\n The ethics of truth telling does not work in the Alzheimers world.\n"

For most of the high-tier stuff, Bruce makes sure the basic concepts are sound and then leaves the actual science to people in that career. He knows a bit more than the basics for each study (medicines, electronics, computing, etc), but really only specializes in strategy and problem solving. Most of the things he makes himself are usually reverse engineered tech he got somewhere else.\n Tony is often portrayed as almost the complete opposite. He's a scientist with strategist friends to make sure he's not putting his effort into something completely superfluous. He's presented with a problem or concept, then figures the rest out on his own. He's a mastermind in most fields, and bounces some of his ideas off other super scientists like Banner, Spiderman, Pym and Mr Fantastic, but is usually only the techie and funding of the Avengers, leaving strategy to specialists like Cap, Widow and Hawkeye.\n"

    "question": "Why is Israel attacking Damascus from Lebanese air space?",
    "answer": "Israel is entirely built on deceit, this is just their nature. To attack from Lebanon airspace hiding behind civilian airplanes is their way of proving their cowardice and malign nature.\n Last time they attacked Syria from the occupied Golan Heights the retaliation of the SAA was surprising for them and stunned them.\n When they attacked the military post in Lattakia from behind the [LINKED_TEXT: Russian IL20 airplane] [URL: https://www.syrianews.cc/s300-air-defense-delivered-syria/], they didn’t expect the Syrians would actually fire at them.

If it had hit one of their fighter jets it would have been better for them.\n Since the delivery, finally, of the 4 decades old S300 batteries to Syria, Israeli fighter jets became more exposed to the air-defense missiles. If an S200 in the hands of the SAA could shoot down an F16, what would the S300 in those hands do?\n[LINKED_TEXT: Syria Confronts New Israeli Aggression; Shoots Down Criminal F-16 | Syria News] [URL: https://www.syrianews.cc/syria-confronts-israeli-aggression/]\n Not only they used the Lebanese high mountains separating Syria from Lebanon as a cover, they also used two civilian airplanes carrying hundreds of passengers as their cover.

And in NO SELF-DEFENSE?!\n The Syrian Air-Defense heroes held back from firing at the fighter jets hiding behind the commercial planes in order to avoid a catastrophe, but did shoot an air-defense missile over Haifa, occupied Palestine aka Israel, which blew up and caused massive damage and horror in the region there, especially near the town of Khdeira.\n That response was the Syrians telling the Israelis: Next time expect these missiles instead of shooting the civilian airplanes you’re hiding behind will fall on more strategic targets deep inside your territories when defending Syrian skies.\n Let’s hope the Israelis got the message and learned the lesson, this time.\nREAD: [LINKED_TEXT: Israel Bombs Damascus to Spoil First Terror-Free Christmas Celebration] [URL: https://www.syrianews.cc/israel-bombs-damascus-christmas/]\n"

    "question": "As a Buddhist, how can I increase my level of compassion without being taken advantage of?",
    "answer": "This is a real concern. The Tibetan Buddhist teacher Chögyam Trungpa talked about the difference between compassion and “idiot compassion.” The difference lies in our perceptiveness about what is truly needed in a situation. Idiot compassion is about always trying to give people what they want, while true compassion is about giving them what they need.\n To know the difference between these things we need wisdom. Luckily, wisdom is not far away, for, according to the Buddhist teachings, it is an innate aspect of our minds. But we are usually prevented from accessing it by our habitual reactiveness and mistaken way of looking at things. If we look carefully at the reasons we tend to be taken advantage of, we’ll find things like people-pleasing tendencies and a desire to be liked or accepted. These things come from low self-esteem and are actually ego-reinforcing. They show where we need to develop and strengthen ourselves.\n So one key here is that the first target or recipient of our compassion should be ourselves: what do we need that will help us the most, benefit us the most? And how can we give that to ourselves? Do we know how to be generous to ourselves, not in a greedy, selfish way, but in a wise, kind way? What if we were our own best friend or our own child or our own dog? What kind of care and concern would we show for ourselves? By treating ourselves well, looking after ourselves properly, we’re starting to show the respect and esteem that we deserve, and we might not feel so needy about getting the approval of others.\n At the same time, when it comes to other people who might need help, we can learn to trust our gut instincts. For if there is something not right about a situation, something wrong or unjust, we will probably sense it if we pay attention to our inner voice. Deep down, we usually know when we’re being unfairly taken advantage of. Sometimes the most compassionate thing is to say no, and to help others by letting them stand on their own feet and help themselves.\n A further piece of good news is that compassion is also, according to the Buddhist teachings, part of our standard equipment. It comes as naturally to us as breathing, as long as we’re not involved in ego trips. So we don’t need to overthink things. As long as you’re practicing the Buddhist teachings, then your compassion is probably gradually growing stronger as you move ever more into a fully sane way way of life. The teachings have the effect of softening your heart, and people with soft hearts do compassionate things.\n"

They can also be expensive to maintain, with costs including food, shelter, and medical expenses. Additionally, they have specific social and behavioral needs that must be met to ensure their well-being.\n In many urban or suburban areas, it may not be legal to keep these animals as pets due to zoning regulations or other laws. Even in rural areas, there may be restrictions on how many animals you can keep and what types of animals are allowed.\n If you are considering a horse, cow, or donkey as a pet, it is important to do your research and make sure you are prepared to provide for their needs. You should also consult with your local authorities to ensure that you are complying with any relevant laws and regulations.\n Ultimately, while it is possible to have a horse, cow, or donkey as a pet, it is not a decision that should be taken lightly.

    "question": "What is the purpose of a university education? Is it primarily to learn or to acquire credentials for a future job?",
    "answer": "This is a very good question, and different people will give you wildly different answers, largely based upon whether they are products of a liberal arts education program or a technical/professional preparatory education program.\n “Liberal arts education” is often mistaken to be an education in the humanities. Rather, it is the classical structure of education developed by natural philosophers beginning with Aristotle. It relies heavily on discourse and logical communication, and presumes that an “educated person” will have a wide body of general knowledge and the mental training to parse new data into their knowledge structure. A liberal arts education teaches students how to learn, and how to communicate what they’ve learned by writing about it.\n A technical education is often mistaken to be an education in computers or machines. Rather, it is an education strategy that relies on field-specific competencies, usually to prepare a student for future professional training, such as medical school. It is a holdover of guild training, where credentials are a description of one’s competency and ability to work. For example, a journeyman would be a skilled worker employed by master craftsman. For a medical doctor, residency=journeyman, and for a researcher, post-doc=journeyman.\n Obviously both strategies have strengths and weaknesses, and a quality education will integrate aspects of both. An expert should have a fundamental ability to communicate logically about many topics, but also extensive technical knowledge and competency in his/her own field.\n"

    "answer": "In standard English notation it’s “Dunedin”.\n So, when Scottish colonists settled the southern end of New Zealand’s South Island, they wanted to build a new “Edinburgh” in their new South Pacific homeland. But the name “Edinburgh” was already taken, so their new city was christened “Dunedin”:\nSource: [LINKED_TEXT: Wikipedia] [URL: http://wikipedia.org/]\n Above the statue of Robbie Burns at the centre of the Octagon, the central plaza of Dunedin. Unfortunately, it is the Anglican cathedral (St. Paul’s) in the background. The proper Presbyterian church is just to the southeast of the Octagon, and if the photo were taken looking the opposite direction you could see it:\nFirst Church of Otago (source: wikipedia.org)\n The small river which flows through Dunedin is named, naturally enough, “The Water of the Leith” after the river which flows through Edinburgh. They unfortunately omitted to name the long inlet of the sea, on which Dunedin lies, the Firth of Forth; but other than that all steps were taken to ensure that the new city would remind the settlers of Auld Reeky. (The weather also matches — because Dunedin lies at the south of the South Island, it is perpetually cold, grey, and damp.)\n (And lovers of England — do not despair. Half-way up the east coast of the South Island lies the fair city of Christchurch. Here men of England, Anglicans in fact, settled and founded the perfectly English city. It is not modelled on any specific English city, rather it represents the perfect English city — the English city of the imagination as opposed to all those in reality which all fall short in one way or another of the ideal. Regrettably, there doesn’t seem to have been a sufficiently large contingent of Welshmen to build “New Cardiff” somewhere… )\n"

Schools have been open since August and businesses never closed. If Biden wants to unite the country ( as he's always saying ) he'll go to Mount Rushmore take off his mask and burn it. Kristi Noems would make a great president, maybe in 2024 she'll be the one to unite the country because Biden has failed.\n"

    "question": "Could Data pass the Kobayashi Maru in Star Trek?",
    "answer": "While it’s an amazing piece of Star Trek lore and was put to great use in Star Trek’s best movie, the Kobayashi Maru test would never work in real life.\n The point of the Kobayashi Maru is to experience the unwinnable situation. Many members of Starfleet are hyper-successful. They’re the best of the best, the most over-achieving over-achievers you’ve ever seen. Athletic, supremely intelligent, and driven. The Kobayashi Maru is a means to introduce cadets and junior officers to facets of the real world, and in real life there are times when you can’t win. Life isn’t just a scaled-up version of some academy test, it’s bigger and more dangerous and there guarantees that there is a right answer among the options.\n Also…you can die.\n There’s a good reason to introduce young officers and cadets to all of these concepts. The Kobayashi Maru is the in-universe way Starfleet did this with some students.\n It would never work though. The key factor in making the Kobayashi Maru test work is that the people taking it would need to think the test was legit and solvable. Serving an overachieving cadet a hot bowl of failure to digest is the whole point, and once everyone knows that the test isn’t beatable then it loses all its psychological power. That feeling of surprise and failure that Saavik experienced in The Wrath of Khan is the point.\n The very question of whether Data could “pass” the Kobayashi Maru test misunderstands it. There’s no “passing” this test, there’s simply experiencing it and hopefully gaining some maturity and perspective from the experience. Data couldn’t pass this test, because no one can pass it. Even Kirk didn’t pass it, despite his legendary bit of cheating. Starfleet commended his ingenuity, but otherwise the victory meant nothing. It wasn’t some test that he had to pass before becoming a captain, it was just an experience that Starfleet gave its cadets to better understand themselves and their new role.\n"

    "question": "How big does a sample size need to be in a survey where the population is 200 million people?",
    "answer": "The sample size needed in a survey depends on several factors, such as the level of precision desired, the level of confidence desired, the variability of the population, and the type of sampling method used.\n Assuming a 95% level of confidence and a margin of error of 5%, the minimum sample size needed for a population of 200 million people is approximately 385. However, increasing the margin of error or decreasing the level of confidence would result in a smaller required sample size, and decreasing the margin of error or increasing the level of confidence would result in a larger required sample size.\n Keep in mind that these are only minimum sample sizes, and larger sample sizes may be needed to achieve a higher level of precision or confidence. Additionally, using PowerCX's online panel service with access to 800 million consumers and 500+ tags can enable you to accurately reach your target audience and obtain hundreds of responses within a day, making sample size calculations less of a concern.\n"

    "question": "What do you think, is Robert Mueller lying or telling the truth?",
    "answer": "There were many facts reported before the Mueller report was released. Many things collected in the report only confirm what was already known. For instance, it had been reported that the Trump team had a hand in the distribution of the hacked emails. There were facts to back that up.\n According to the Mueller report, members of the 2016 Trump campaign had a series of contacts with Wiki-Leaks and people close to its operation regarding leaked Clinton campaign emails, even planning a press strategy ahead of their release, according to Robert Mueller’s report.\n In the report, Mueller also found that members of Trump’s campaign repeatedly sought to acquire Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails at the direction of Donald Trump himself. This information had surfaced long before the Report was made public.\n Russian Hackers stole Democratic emails and sent those emails to Wikileaks, who released thousands of hacked emails during the 2016 Presidential Campaign. Than Wikileaks communicated directly with two Trump advisers over Twitter, specifically Trump Jr. and Roger Stone, a long time adviser to Donald Trump. The facts we have indicate that Roger Stone claimed to the Trump Campaign that he had a back-channel to Wikileaks. We also know Donald Trump asked Stone about the Wikileaks plan according to The Mueller report. So we have established that they were aware of what was happening in regards to the hacked emails. It’s also important to note they lied about knowing.\n The above example was first reported by numerous sources and would later be confirmed in the Mueller report. Just like the Trump tower meeting which had been reported long before the Mueller report, both the reported facts and the Mueller report would confirm it. Since many facts Mueller would release in his report match the facts reported earlier, it would be hard not to believe the report itself. Although there would be some new revelations concerning Trump in the special council’s investigation, the substance of his report accurately matches information already released and made public. Whether the report is the full truth, we cannot know. What we do know is many of his findings match the facts that had been reported earlier.\n .\n"

    "question": "Nuclear power plants are still just steam generators. What would it take to actually harness the power of the atom? By that I mean, use the radiation directly without so many conversions, i.e. radiation-heat-steam-mechanical-electricty?",
    "answer": "Nuclear reactors DO harness the power of the atom, you’re just misunderstanding how EXACTLY enough.\n The radiation produced by nuclear fission isn’t the primary release of energy, it’s a necessary byproduct & a hazard that must be dealt with.\n The majority of the energy that comes from every atom that fissions is over 200MeV of KINETIC energy (heat) imparted on the FISSION FRAGMENTS that used to be the nucleus of the atom that fissioned. That might not seem like a lot of energy but 235 grams of U-235 contains about 6x10^23 atoms. The radiation released by gamma radiation isn’t insignificant, but it’s also turned into heat. Those fission fragments are unstable & they will give off decay gammas, more heat. The neutrons released by the fission are born “fast” over 2MeV each & in order to cause another fission they will dump that kinetic energy into moderator atoms, more heat.\n Heat is the “coin of the realm” for extracting energy from nuclear reactors. Better heat engines would be great to increase efficiency, but remember first & foremost, it’s the kinetic energy of the molecules, not the radiation that does the work.\n"

    "question": "Why do large ships use anchor chains and not anchor lines (i.e. land lubber’s ropes)?",
    "answer": "Anchors are most efficient and dig into the seabed best when the direction of strain is close to parallel to the seabed. An anchor rode made of chain is far heavier than rope and this aids in anchoring, both by its weight and by its angle of strain.   Chain will lay across the seabed more easily than a rope, and thus make the strain from the anchor more parallel to the sea bed, causing it to bite or hook better into the sea floor.  So lighter is not better.\nFurthermore an anchor rode is always subject to chafing and abrasion as it lies on the sea floor with surface waves and tides pulling and releasing it. A rode made of rope would fray as the motion of the sea moves the rode back and forth over rocks on the sea floor. A chain is obviously much more resistant to wear and tear.\n[Edit:  Just to clarify -  \"The vessel is attached to the anchor by the rode, which is made of chain, cable, rope, or a combination of these. The ratio of the length of rode to the water depth is known as the scope. Anchoring with sufficient scope and/or heavy chain rode brings the direction of strain close to parallel with the seabed.\"  Wikipedia]\n"

    "question": "Can you tame an older feral cat?",
    "answer": "Based on the experiences of friends who've taken in older feral cats, you will first of all, after bringing them home, expect them to hide under your furniture for a very long time - maybe months - only coming out at night to eat and use the litter box, while you're sleeping. If you're patient, and spend a lot of time lying on the floor, and leaving treats near you, you might eventually get them to the point where they will stay out from under the furniture while you are awake, and even come close enough to you to pick up the treats that you've left on the floor. They may or may not ever warm up to you enough to allow you to touch them, though.\n Furthermore, if the cat is a male, you need to be aware that you would never be able to break that cat of marking his territory, spraying all your furniture, and the corners of walls. Even neutered male feral cats quite likely will not have been neutered young enough to keep them from developing that habit. Cats have not been domesticated for as long, or as thoroughly as dogs, and so their wildness is often much closer to the surface.\n There are groups, such as Alley Cat Allies, who feed feral cats, and take care of getting them spayed or neutered. There's a very strong reason why these groups don't make efforts to get feral cats put into homes - it's very difficult to domesticate a feral cat - often impossible.\n Sometimes people we'll have better luck with a feral cat if they already have are cat or cats who are domesticated and comfortable in their environments, (but the spraying thing with male cats would still apply - Maybe more so, since they would be sharing territory with another animal of the same species). If you want to give a home to an unwanted cat, you will do better to go to a shelter and adopt one, if your intention is that they be the only cat.\n"

    "answer": "Did you know that you, yes YOU, are made up of DNA, mRNA, and tRNA, all with their own unique structural differences? It's true! These three molecules play vital roles in the functioning of your cells, and they each have their own distinct characteristics that make them special.\n First, let's talk about DNA. This molecule is made up of two strands of nucleotides that are twisted together in a double helix structure. The nucleotides are joined by covalent bonds, and the order of the nucleotides encodes the genetic information that is passed from one generation to the next.\n Next up is mRNA, or messenger RNA. This molecule is also made up of nucleotides, but it is typically single stranded rather than double stranded like DNA. mRNA carries the genetic information from the DNA in the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, where it is used to synthesize proteins.\n Finally, there's tRNA, or transfer RNA. This molecule is much smaller than DNA or mRNA, and it has a unique cloverleaf shape. tRNA plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by bringing the amino acids to the ribosomes and placing them in the correct order according to the instructions encoded in the mRNA.\n So there you have it! DNA, mRNA, and tRNA may have different structures, but they all work together to keep your cells functioning properly. In fact, all three of these molecules are present within you right now, reading this very text!\n"

The extent to which a bank teller can inquire about the purpose of a cash withdrawal depends on the policies and regulations of the specific bank and the country in which it operates.\n [LINKED_TEXT: SOUNDPROOF MATS] [URL: https://sounddeadeningstore.co.uk/]\n In many countries, financial institutions are required to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML regulations. These regulations are designed to prevent illegal activities such as money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud. As part of these regulations, banks may have policies in place that require tellers to ask customers about the purpose of a cash withdrawal exceeding a certain threshold. This helps banks identify and report any suspicious transactions as required by law.\n It's important to note that the purpose of the inquiry is typically to fulfill regulatory requirements and ensure the security of the banking system. Bank tellers are trained to handle customer inquiries in a professional and confidential manner. If you have concerns about privacy or the specific policies of your bank regarding cash withdrawals, it is best to consult with the bank directly or refer to their customer information materials to understand their practices and guidelines.\n"

When smoking is tied to your coming-of-age, whether you like it or not, it is part of your identity and critical as your emotional support system.\n You will have a very reall existential fear of giving up and facing the void.\n What you don’t know - but the tobacco companies do - is that you have just initiated yourself into the adult world by way of a tobacco addiction and to stop it, you will have to revisit your teen years and unravel the motivation that took you there.

    "question": "Why is encryption so much easier than decryption in cryptography?",
    "answer": "Re “Why is encryption so much easier than decryption in cryptography?”, it’s for the same reason that unbreaking a glass is much harder than breaking it, and unkilling a man is much harder than killing him: entropy. Things fall apart easily, but putting them back together is much more difficult.\n The whole idea behind having encryption in the first place is to make encrypting easy but decryption billions of times harder. What good would it be to encrypt something (say, an online purchase involving sending your bank account number to a vendor) if it was hard to encrypt or easy to decrypt? That would be useless. By necessity, the encryption must be blazing fast (so that it only takes 5 seconds — rather than 5 years — to buy a $29 6-pack of light bulbs), and decryption sans key must take a billion years (so that a criminal intercepting the transmission cannot bleed your bank account dry).\n To implement that, modern encryption schemes are “trap door”, meaning that encryption is fast and easy, and decryption with the key is also fast and easy, but decryption without the key would take a computer program a billion years (or some such impractically long period of time). Anything else would be useless.\n For much more information on this, see this Wikipedia article:\n [LINKED_TEXT: Trapdoor function - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapdoor_function]\n"

Not from Russian bullets, but from cold, exposure and hunger, caused by having them march - twice - over the Anatolian mountains in the depths of winter without winter clothing, shelter, transport or food supplies.\n The Armenians – who had already survived the Turkish Hamidian Massacres directed against them in 1894–96, then again in 1906, 1909 and 1912/13 – undoubtedly viewed the Russians as their saviours, and helped them any way they could.\n Enver blamed them for his ‘defeat’, turned the resentment for all the Turkish army deaths onto them, and proposed a ‘Final Solution to the Armenian Problem’. He convinced Djemal. Talaat was deputed to carry it out.\n Djemal, Enver and Talaat Pashas were the ‘Young Turks’ of the CUP Committee of Union & Progress.\n"

The motivation is social responsibility, and the main purpose is to keep those high school students from going astray.\nHigh school students join the NBA, and it is easy to go astray after retirement. Players usually earn a lot of wealth after being successful in the NBA. Whether it is James, Harden and others, they all have a life of lavish money, and many players have ruined their careers because of drug addiction. It can be seen that entering the league will earn a lot of wealth. Many famous players have almost ruined their careers, and high school students have poor control over wealth. They do not have a complete world view and higher education to restrain themselves. It is possible to go astray in the face of enormous wealth after success. Therefore, the reason why high school students are not allowed to join the NBA is because high school students are easy to go astray.\nAnd high school students join the NBA, and life after retirement will be very difficult. After all, there are only a few successful players in the NBA. The vast majority of players may not be able to earn enough money to spend their entire lives. They need to make a living by themselves, and even many players have to do various jobs. It can be seen that entering the league does not necessarily lead to success, and high school students will inevitably have less knowledge because they have not studied in college, and their ability to survive in society will be even worse, so life after retirement will become a big problem. Therefore, the reason why high school students are not allowed to join the NBA is because life after retirement is more difficult.\n"

    "question": "If Martian soil is toxic, can't be terraformed, and there is no way to retain an atmosphere, why is Elon Musk so determined to plant a colony there?",
    "answer": "Firstly - bear in mind Musk’s motive here.\n He believes (correctly, IMHO) that humanity will eventually be wiped out - perhaps by a killer-meteorite impact - perhaps by global nuclear war - perhaps by a pandemic disease - perhaps by the eruption of the Yellowstone Super-Volcano - perhaps by runaway global warming.\n The idea is to build a small (by human standards) colony somewhere OTHER than Earth which could survive a global catastrophe on Earth - and eventually return to re-populate the Earth.\n That requires a 100% self-sufficient off-earth colony…of sufficient size to have a gene-pool large enough to continue the arts and sciences - and to repopulate the Earth without too much of a genetic bottleneck and associated in-breeding.\n Mars is literally the ONLY place (other than Earth) that could support a within reach of plausible technology - and could ever become a self-sustaining colony.\n Mars will be INCREDIBLY difficult to push to the point of self-sustainability - but there is nothing about the planet that makes it actually impossible.\n"

Other popular applications would be is AIMP, PI Player, Pulsar Music Player. PowerAMP, etc.\n Will you have the “highest quality” audio from your device/headphones combo? That will depend on the phones and on the device itself. The fact that your device can play the files does not guarantee the best audio quality out there. Some devices may have better quality DAC/Amp solutions than others and the sound quality of your headphones will also have a large influence on the outcome. All you can be sure is that the Flac file will probably sound better than an MP3 file. And, just because it is a Flac file it does not also guarantee you the best audio quality. There are plenty of Flac files out there than have been created from MP3 files. There are plenty of audio converters that can do just that: [LINKED_TEXT: Convert your MP3 to FLAC for Free Online] [URL: https://www.zamzar.com/convert/mp3-to-flac/].

    "question": "Did Aristotle Onassis's daughter Christina get along with Jackie Kennedy Onassis?",
    "answer": "Not really.\n Christina never got over her parents’ divorce and lent a sympathetic ear when her father complained about how Jackie spent his money. After her brother Alexander died in a plane crash, Christina shared her father’s feeling that Jackie had brought bad luck into the family. And when Onassis died, Christina was at his bedside, but Jackie was not.\n The simmering animosity came to a full boil once the patriarch was gone. On the way to the cemetery, Ted Kennedy, riding in the same limousine with Jackie and Christina, said it was time to discuss Jackie’s inheritance. Christina was so furious that she ordered the limo driver to stop; she got out and rode the rest of the way with her aunts in another car. Although it was Ted Kennedy who had tastelessly brought up Jackie’s dower rights, Christina might have thought that Jackie had put him up to it.\n Only after her husband’s death did Jackie discover that instead of a costly divorce, he had decided to cut her off from the inheritance she was anticipating as the widow of a Greek citizen. He was friendly with the military junta ruling Greece, and the junta controlled what news appeared in Greek newspapers. So she had no way of knowing that the junta had quietly changed the inheritance laws so that she’d be left with almost nothing. The law was written so artfully that it applied to almost no widow except Jackie.\n After Jackie sued, Christina decided to give her $26 million to get rid of her. But a condition of the settlement was that Jackie had to continue using the surname Onassis so that, as Christina said, she wouldn’t forget where the money had come from.\n"

    "question": "How long does a pair of denim jeans last you?",
    "answer": "The lifespan of a pair of denim jeans or a hand-painted denim jacket can vary widely depending on several factors:\nQuality of Materials: Higher quality denim and craftsmanship often result in longer-lasting garments. Well-made denim jeans and jackets tend to hold up better over time compared to cheaper options.Frequency of Wear: If you wear the jeans or jacket frequently, they may experience more wear and tear, which can shorten their lifespan.Activities: The type of activities you engage in while wearing the denim can impact its longevity. If you're doing activities that subject the fabric to a lot of stress or abrasion, the clothing might wear out more quickly.Care and Maintenance: Proper care can significantly extend the life of denim items. Washing them infrequently, using gentle cycles, and avoiding excessive heat from dryers can help preserve the fabric and color.Fit: The fit of the jeans or jacket can also play a role. If the fit is too tight, the fabric might be strained more during movement, potentially leading to faster wear.Style and Trends: Fashion trends can affect how long you continue to wear a particular piece. If a specific style goes out of fashion, you might be less likely to wear it regularly.Personal Preferences: Some individuals prefer a worn-in look and don't mind minor signs of aging on their denim items, while others prefer to keep them looking new for as long as possible.Environmental Factors: The climate and environment you live in can also impact the wear and tear on your denim. Harsh weather conditions or exposure to excessive sunlight can affect the fabric and colors.\nOn average, a well-maintained pair of high-quality denim jeans can last several years of regular wear, ranging from 2 to 5 years or more. However, this is just a general estimate, and individual experiences can vary widely.\n As for a hand-painted denim jacket like the Rebelle Theory one you mentioned, the lifespan would depend on similar factors. The painted design might add a unique touch, but it could also be more delicate than the denim fabric itself. If the paint is well-applied and the jacket is cared for properly, it could last for several years as well. Just keep in mind that the hand-painted elements might be more susceptible to damage, so gentle handling and careful maintenance will be important.\n"

    "question": "How does the earning potential of YouTube compare to other social media platforms, such as Instagram and TikTok?",
    "answer": "The earning potential of YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok varies depending on several factors such as the number of followers, engagement rate, niche, and type of content created.\n In general, YouTube tends to have higher earning potential compared to Instagram and TikTok due to several factors such as:\nAdvertising revenue: YouTube offers advertising revenue to content creators who are part of the YouTube Partner Program. This program allows creators to monetize their videos through advertisements that play before or during their content.Longer videos: YouTube allows longer-form content, which can lead to higher engagement and more opportunities for advertising. This also means creators can provide more in-depth content and build a stronger following.Searchability: YouTube has a search function that allows users to find content based on specific keywords, making it easier for creators to be discovered by new viewers.\nHowever, Instagram and TikTok offer different earning opportunities. Instagram has a more diverse range of revenue streams, such as sponsored posts, brand deals, and affiliate marketing. TikTok also offers sponsored posts and brand deals, as well as a creator fund that pays popular creators for their content.\n Ultimately, the earning potential of each platform depends on the individual creator's goals, audience, and content. Many creators use multiple social media platforms to diversify their income streams and reach different audiences.\n"

    "question": "How do I tell if I'm an Enneagram 4 or 5?",
    "answer": "The best way to tell if you are a type 4 and a type 5 is why you like to spend time alone.\n The Type 5: They like to spend time alone because they need to recharge or are contemplating topics that fascinate them. They start each day with about a 30% battery and feel that time spent with others drains them almost to the point of catastrophic depletion. The Type 5 is not anti-people, they just spend so much of their mental resources contemplating topics that interest them they often have nothing left to give when others require their time and energy. They are always contemplating topics that interests them in the pursuit of mastery and find a great deal of satisfaction in being highly capable and competent in them.\n The Type 4: They like to spend time alone because they are exploring the depths of their feelings or drifting into fantasy. They can tap into their inner feelings in a way that few others can and desire to experience them (both good and bad) completely. In this place, they can drift off into fantasy and paint an ideal of the world around them which is perhaps more of what they would like to see rather than what it actually is. At the same time they are very authentic people with tremendous depth and creative expression.\n Hope this helps, for more on the Enneagram types see a primer on each type:\n[LINKED_TEXT: What’s All The Buzz About The Enneagram?] [URL: https://medium.com/the-enneagram/whats-all-the-buzz-about-the-enneagram-671f01aad24d]\n"

    "question": "What are quarks and leptons? Can someone explain it to me as simply as possible?",
    "answer": "Leptons are electrons and their cousins.\n Quarks are the particles that make up protons, neutrons, and rarer subatomic particles.\n Protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons, make up atoms. Atoms make up molecules. Molecules make up all the stuff you see around you. So ultimately, quarks and leptons make up all the stuff you see around you.\n If you zoom in on, say, a wooden chair, you’ll eventually come to a cellulose chain, a macromolecule made of a bunch of cellulose molecules chained together. Zoom in on one of those cellulose molecules, and it’s made of 6 carbon, 10 hydrogen, and 5 oxygen atoms. Zoom in on one of those hydrogen atoms, and you’ll see one of these shapes:\nThat’s an electron, orbiting a nucleus in the middle made of a single proton.\n Zoom in on the proton, and you’ll say… well, it’s a complicated dance of particles appearing and disappearing, but there’s always 2 up quarks and 1 down quark and everything else cancels out.\n Zoom in on the electron or one of the quarks, however, and you just get a bigger and fuzzier picture of the electron or quark.\n There are a few other particles that “make up stuff” in the same way electrons, up quarks, and down quarks do, but they all turn out to be just cousins of each other, and we can easily classify them into leptons (things like electrons) and quarks (things like up quarks). There are hundreds of other things like protons and neutrons, but they’re all made of quarks in the same way. So, as far as we know, there are no other particles that “make up stuff” besides leptons and quarks.\n When you get down to the subatomic realm, forces start acting like particles just as much as stuff acts like particles. But these particles, like photons, act differently from quarks and leptons. For example, you can’t build bigger things out of them. So, we divide the subatomic particles into fermions (things like electrons, which make up stuff) and bosons (things like photons, which carry interactions between stuff), and then divide fermions into quarks (things like up quarks, that make up protons and other big things) and leptons (things like electrons, which orbit things made of quarks).\n"

Charudeva shastri had written a book, 50 years back called “Vaag-vyavahaara-aadarsha”, specially for people who are into Translating Sanskrit works in Hindi.\n Since the complex words are going to be used as they are, only the verb part translation becomes difficult from Sanskrit to Hindi nowadays.\n"

    "question": "How do I get 100+ blooms on a pansy flower plant?",
    "answer": "There are a few key steps you can take to get 100+ blooms on a pansy flower plant:\nPlanting time: Plant your pansy seeds or seedlings in the fall or early spring. Pansies prefer cooler temperatures and will bloom best in the cooler months of the year.Proper soil: Pansies prefer well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter. Make sure to amend the soil with compost or other organic matter before planting.Sunlight: Pansies prefer partial shade to full sun, but they can tolerate full sun if they are provided with consistent moisture.Watering: Pansies need consistent moisture in order to bloom well. Water your pansies regularly, making sure to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.Fertilizer: Feed your pansies with a balanced fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season.Pinching: Pinching back the tips of the plants when they are 4-5 inches tall will encourage bushiness and more blooms.Deadheading: Remove spent blooms regularly to encourage new blooms to form.Mulching: Apply a 2-3 inches layer of mulch around the base of the plant to help retain moisture and suppress weeds.Disease and Pest Control: Keep an eye out for common pests and diseases such as aphids, slugs, and powdery mildew. Treat them promptly to avoid damage to the plants.\nBy following these steps, you can increase the chances of getting 100+ blooms on a pansy flower plant. Keep in mind that different varieties of pansies can have different growth habits and requirements, so it is always best to consult the seed packet or a gardening expert for specific instructions for the variety you are growing.\n"

    "question": "Which is the most unbiased news outlet?",
    "answer": "Determining the most empirically neutral, objective, nonpartisan and unbiased news sources in the US can be a complex and subjective process, as individual biases can influence perceptions of what is considered neutral or unbiased. However, there are several news sources that are widely recognized for their efforts to provide objective and nonpartisan reporting. Here are some options:\nReuters: Reuters is a global news organization that has a reputation for providing impartial and reliable news coverage. It aims to deliver news without any political bias, commentary or opinion.Associated Press (AP): The AP is a not-for-profit news organization that is known for its impartial and unbiased news reporting. It is a cooperative owned by its contributing newspapers, radio and television stations in the United States, which means that it is not influenced by any particular media company or individual.BBC News: The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a publicly-funded international news organization that provides impartial and nonpartisan coverage of global news and events. While the BBC is based in the UK, it has a global network of correspondents and bureaus and is widely regarded for its objective reporting.The Wall Street Journal: The Wall Street Journal is a US-based newspaper that is known for its high-quality journalism and nonpartisan reporting. While it has been accused of having a conservative bias in some of its editorial content, its news reporting is widely considered to be objective and neutral.NPR (National Public Radio): NPR is a nonprofit media organization that provides news and cultural programming to public radio stations across the United States. It is known for its objective and nonpartisan reporting, and its journalists are held to strict standards of impartiality.\nIt's important to note that even these sources can have biases or make mistakes. It's always a good idea to read news from multiple sources and to stay aware of your own biases and how they might influence your interpretation of the news.\n"

    "question": "How do you get a name changed on a birth certificate? I recently found out that my dad is not my biological dad, but I have his last name and he's on my birth certificate. How did my mom get this all changed and am I able to get it changed back?",
    "answer": "In most states in the USA, if the woman who gave birth is married when the birth certificate(s) for her child(ren) is being created, the husband’s name will be recorded as the father unless the mother tells them to do something different. In English law (and thus in most US states that were originally English colonies), the husband of a newborn’s mother is the legal father of the child, even if he was not around for the child’s conception and thus could not be the bio-dad. A legal father could disown a child that he didn’t think was his, but otherwise children were assumed to have been conceived within the bonds of matrimony. So it is likely your mother did nothing to get her husband’s name on your birth certificate, she just didn’t tell the hospital that there was another possible father to the child.\n You and your bio-dad can both get DNA tests to prove his paternity conclusively (blood tests can’t prove a man is your father, they can only prove that certain men with incompatible blood types could not possibly be your bio-dad). Once armed with proof, you should be able to go to the clerk of courts that registered the original birth certificate, and get it amended appropriately. But do you really want to disown the man who was the only father you knew as a child?\n"

    "question": "How many times can you extend OPT?",
    "answer": "If an F-1 student earns multiple degrees at different academic levels (such as a bachelor's degree followed by a master's degree), they may be eligible for a new 12-month period of OPT for each higher degree earned. However, the student must be able to provide evidence that each degree is from an accredited institution of higher education in the United States and that each degree is at a higher educational level than the previous one.\n Additionally, if the F-1 student qualifies for the STEM OPT extension based on their most recent degree, they may be able to apply for a 24-month STEM OPT extension for each degree, subject to the same eligibility requirements for the STEM OPT extension program.\n It's important to note that the total period of OPT, including any possible extensions, cannot exceed 36 months. Therefore, if an F-1 student qualifies for the STEM OPT extension for each of their degrees, they can work for up to 36 months in total, which includes the initial 12-month OPT period and any possible STEM OPT extensions.\n"

    "question": "Are teachers who tell students that \"math is racist\" actually hampering the future success of those students?",
    "answer": "You may recall in 1992 when Mattel kicked up a firestorm of controversy when it shipped a talking Barbie that included, among its hundreds of other clichéd utterances, that “Math class is tough!”\n This would implant into girls’ brains that they’re not wired to do Math, thus lowering their expectations of themselves, resulting in them doing poorly at Math. A self-fulfilling prophesy.\n What they were really saying was that females are uniquely gullible. That’s sexist, IMO.\n Fast forward to 2021 (or whenever it started). We’re now telling black students that math is racist. IOW, the evil white community has figured out how to present Math in such a way that it’s incompatible with their presumably primitive brains, thus forcing them to the end of the proverbial line for good paying tech jobs. This lowers their expectations of themselves, resulting in them doing poorly at Math. An effective strategy of a true racist.\n At best, that’s racism of low expectations. At worst, it's a deliberate attempt to keep black students behind their white counterparts. And it’s offensive, IMO.\n"

    "question": "Is the American school grading system flawed?",
    "answer": "What do you call a major league baseball player - a professional who has spent years working on developing their skills, who is in the top fraction of one percent of people in doing what they do, and who is paid in the middle six figures if not seven figures - who fails to get a hit 6 times out of 10 at bats?\n You call them a Hall of Fame player with their amazing .400 batting average.\n Now:\n What do you call a kid who is learning something brand new, and who is successful 5 times out of ten?\n You call them a failure, because under the standard grading rubric, over 90% is an A, over 80% is a B, over 70% is a C, over 60% is a D, and anything less than 60% is an F.\n There is a push to “fix” this by giving 50% credit on every assignment - whether or not the student even attempts to complete it. That is not a solution - that is pure stupidity, as well as being dishonest.\n Why not simply adjust the percentages for the letter grades, so that maybe 80% is an A, 60% is a B, 40% is a C, 20% is a D, and less than 20% is an F? Some parent swill still complain that their kids get an F.\n Better yet, use a different system, such as straight percentages, or “progress towards mastery” grading.\n With progress towards mastery in a quarter system (four grading periods in a school year), a zero is no effort/learning, a 1 is beginning to learn, a 2 is making progress towards grade level mastery, a 3 is nearing grade level mastery, and a 4 shows that grade level mastery has been achieved. Some will want to include higher numbers for “exceeding” grade level mastery - but those are not necessary. the zero through four (zero to three for a three grading period school year) must be included for the system to work. No student who fails to perform at grade level should be given a grade of “achieved mastery”.\n Please note that, whatever system is used, many parents will complain if their child is not given the highjest possible grade - even when their child is not performing at grade level (or is even performing several grade levels below the grade they are in).\n"

The eligibility criteria for SSC MTS is that the candidate should have passed 10th standard or equivalent from a recognized board. The selection process consists of a written exam and a descriptive test.On the other hand, SSC CHSL (Combined Higher Secondary Level) is a competitive exam conducted for the recruitment of candidates to various Group-B and Group-C posts in different Ministries, Departments, and Organizations of the Government of India. The eligibility criteria for SSC CHSL is that the candidate should have passed 10+2 or equivalent from a recognized board. The selection process consists of a computer-based exam, a descriptive paper, and a skill test.\n Therefore, the main difference between SSC MTS and SSC CHSL is the level of the exam, eligibility criteria, and selection process. While SSC MTS is a non-technical exam for Group-C posts, SSC CHSL is a competitive exam for both Group-B and Group-C posts. Additionally, SSC CHSL has a more comprehensive selection process, including a computer-based exam, a descriptive paper, and a skill test, while SSC MTS has only a written exam and a descriptive test.\n"

    "question": "What is a metamorphic rock that has changed form from heat and pressure?",
    "answer": "Common metamorphic rocks include phyllite, schist, gneiss, quartzite and marble.\n A metamorphic rock that undergoes metamorphism is a new metamorphic rock, likely with different characteristics owing to a different set of temperature, pressure, and water chemistry. Metamorphic rocks form when rocks are subjected to high heat, high pressure, hot mineral-rich fluids or, more commonly, some combination of these factors. Conditions like these are found deep within the Earth or where tectonic plates meet.\n Process of Metamorphism:The process of metamorphism does not melt the rocks, but instead transforms them into denser, more compact rocks. New minerals are created either by rearrangement of mineral components or by reactions with fluids that enter the rocks. Pressure or temperature can even change previously metamorphosed rocks into new types. Metamorphic rocks are often squished, smeared out, and folded. Despite these uncomfortable conditions, metamorphic rocks do not get hot enough to melt, or they would become igneous rocks!\n Common Metamorphic Rocks:Common metamorphic rocks include phyllite, schist, gneiss, quartzite and marble.\n Foliated Metamorphic Rocks:Some kinds of metamorphic rocks -- granite gneiss and biotite schist are two examples -- are strongly banded or foliated. (Foliated means the parallel arrangement of certain mineral grains that gives the rock a striped appearance.) Foliation forms when pressure squeezes the flat or elongate minerals within a rock so they become aligned. These rocks develop a platy or sheet-like structure that reflects the direction that pressure was applied.\n Non-Foliated Metamorphic Rocks:Non-foliated metamorphic rocks do not have a platy or sheet-like structure. There are several ways that non-foliated rocks can be produced. Some rocks, such as limestone are made of minerals that are not flat or elongate. No matter how much pressure you apply, the grains will not align! Another type of metamorphism, contact metamorphism, occurs when hot igneous rock intrudes into some pre-existing rock. The pre-existing rock is essentially baked by the heat, changing the mineral structure of the rock without addition of pressure.\n Source:\n [LINKED_TEXT: https://usgs.gov/faqs/what-are-metamorphic-rocks-0?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products] [URL: https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-are-metamorphic-rocks-0?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products]\n"

    "answer": "Normally the only difference is one of context. \"Directory\" is an older term that is still current but used more by programmers and expert users who are familiar with accessing the file system via a command line interface.\n \"Folder\" is a newer term that was intended to be more easily understandable by non-expert users, especially those who would normally use the file system via a graphical user interface (GUI). In such a GUI, a directory is often represented by a picture (a.k.a. icon) of a cardboard file folder to emphasize by analogy that it's a place where you would store related documents.\n An interesting exception is the file system used on the very first \"beige toaster\" Macintosh computers. These had a graphical user interface with \"folders\" represented by icons of folders, but there were no actual directories.

    "question": "What are your choices of preference in NEET 2022 counseling?",
    "answer": "NEET 2022 Paper Pattern\n There are four types of question paper. All the papers consist of 150 questions. However, each paper has a different sectional pattern. That means if you get a good score in one section of the paper, you won't necessarily get a good score in the others. Therefore, you need to focus on just one section.\n Section 1: General Science\n There are 40 questions in Section 1, including topics such as chemistry, physics, biology, microbiology, anatomy, etc. There are 30 marks for each correct answer. Thus, if you get 15 points in this section, you'll receive 100% marks. So we recommend that you spend the maximum amount of time in this section.\n Section 2: Chemistry\n This section contains 25 questions. Each question gives 25 marks. This means that you need to earn 125 marks to pass the exam. The chemical concepts covered here are acids, bases, water, solubility, conductivity, oxidation-reduction reaction, etc. We suggest you spend the maximum amount possible of time on this topic.\n Section 3: Physics\n If you're confident about your knowledge of physics, then you don't need to worry about Section 3. There are 30 questions in total and all questions have equal importance. Each question gives 20 marks. Thus, if you earn 120 marks in this section, you will receive 100%. But if you earn only 110 marks, you'll get 99.9%, which isn't enough.\n Section 4: Biology\n In this section, there are 20 questions. Each question covers basic aspects of biology, such as genetics, cells, organelles, reproduction, nutrition, etc. Here, you will need to pay special attention. Since it's quite demanding, you should plan your time carefully.\n"

    "question": "When do you cut back peonies, and do they bloom back?",
    "answer": "Herbaceous peonies are tender-stemmed plants that die back naturally in fall and regrow again in spring.\n Cutting back the dead stems to the ground in fall helps prevent insects and diseases and makes the garden look tidy.\n When you remove the stems, take care not to damage the crown, which is the fleshy part of the plant between the roots and the stems.\n Remove stems that are infested with diseases or insects as soon as you discover the problem. Trim tree peony branches to remove damage caused by winter weather and to correct structural problems in spring.\n The first thing you should know about pruning peonies is where to make the cut. The best place to cut a peony stem is just above a healthy bud. If the stem is diseased, make sure you cut back to healthy wood.\n Do not compost pruned cuttings that are diseased or infested with insects. Burn the stems or bag and discard them instead.\n In cases of severe injury or when the plant is overgrown, remove the entire stem by cutting it close to the ground.\n When two branches cross and rub against each other, remove the least desirable branch. The friction from constant rubbing creates a wound that serves as an entry point for insects and diseases.\n Disbudding is the removal of selected buds to control the size and quantity of the flowers. If you remove the side buds and leave the bud at the tip of a stem, you will get one very large blossom.\n Removing the terminal bud and leaving those along the sides of the stem results in more but smaller flowers.\n"

    "question": "What is the chemical composition of coacerverates, microsperes, and liposomes?",
    "answer": "Coacervates, microspheres, and liposomes are three different types of colloidal particles that have different chemical compositions:\nCoacervates: Coacervates are colloidal particles that form spontaneously from the self-assembly of specific types of polymer molecules in solution. The chemical composition of coacervates depends on the type of polymer used, but they typically contain a core of one type of polymer surrounded by a shell of another type of polymer.Microspheres: Microspheres are small spherical particles that are commonly made from synthetic polymers, such as polystyrene, polyethylene, or polyvinyl alcohol. The chemical composition of microspheres is determined by the type of polymer used, and they can be further modified with surface coatings, such as proteins or lipids, to improve their stability and biocompatibility.Liposomes: Liposomes are spherical particles that are composed of a lipid bilayer membrane that encapsulates an aqueous compartment. The lipid bilayer is made up of phospholipids, which are amphiphilic molecules that have a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head. The chemical composition of liposomes is determined by the type of phospholipids used, and they can be further modified with additional lipids, such as cholesterol, or with functional molecules, such as drugs, to improve their properties and functionality.\nIn summary, the chemical composition of coacervates, microspheres, and liposomes is determined by the type of polymer, lipid, or other functional molecules used to make the particles. This determines the properties and functionality of the particles, and can be tailored to meet specific needs for different applications.\n[LINKED_TEXT: https://thenanobiotechguy.com/] [URL: https://thenanobiotechguy.com/]"

    "question": "Why aren't bullets sharp?",
    "answer": "Most bullets ARE sharp, to varying degrees, except for handgun calibers.\n This makes them slip through the air without losing as much velocity from air resistance.\n Some rifle calibers are round-nosed, and .30–30 bullets are flat-nosed, but the majority of bullets are pointed, for longer range and more accuracy.\n These are un-fired bullets pulled from M-2 .50 Machingun cartridges.\nOr these 162-grain .284 diameter bullets are good for a 7mm Remington Magnum\n  Most rifle bullets are pointed, to one degree or another, a few are not.\n Pistol bullets are another matter. They don’t fly far or fast enough to worry about how they may slip through the air smoothly, or not.\n Most of those are round-nosed, because that’s cheap to make, or “JHC”, Jacketed Hollow Cavity, which expand like the dickens when flesh is hit at distances under 50 yards.\n They can’t create massive damage from sheer speed, as rifles do, so they rely on large-diameter hollow-cavity (or other advanced bullet design) to create a lot of damage to flesh.\n"

    "question": "What are the disadvantages a person can have after becoming a member of a Freemason?",
    "answer": "While Freemasonry has a long and complex history, and opinions about it vary, some individuals perceive certain disadvantages associated with being a Freemason. It's important to note that these perspectives may not apply universally and do not represent the views of all Freemasons. Here are some commonly mentioned disadvantages:\nMisconceptions and Suspicion: Freemasonry has often been shrouded in mystery and secrecy, leading to misconceptions and suspicion from outsiders. Conspiracy theories and unfounded allegations have perpetuated negative stereotypes about Freemasons, potentially leading to social stigma and misunderstandings.Membership Requirements and Selection Process: Freemasonry typically has a membership selection process that involves initiation rituals and the requirement of belief in a higher power. This can be a barrier for individuals who do not meet these criteria or who are uncomfortable with the secretive nature of the initiation process.Time Commitment: Freemasonry involves regular meetings and participation in lodge activities. This commitment may require a significant amount of time, which can be challenging for individuals with busy schedules or other commitments.Financial Obligations: Membership in Freemasonry often entails financial obligations, such as dues and contributions to charitable causes. While these contributions are generally voluntary, they can represent an additional financial burden for some individuals.Lack of Gender Inclusivity: Historically, Freemasonry has been a male-only organization. While there are now some lodges that admit women, the majority of Freemasonry remains exclusively male. This gender exclusivity has been a point of criticism for those advocating for gender equality and inclusivity.Limited Transparency: Freemasonry maintains a certain level of secrecy regarding its rituals, teachings, and internal operations. This lack of transparency can create a sense of exclusivity and suspicion among those who are not part of the organization.Potential Conflict with Personal Beliefs: Freemasonry's requirement of belief in a higher power may clash with the beliefs or principles held by some individuals. Those who identify as atheists or hold non-theistic worldviews may find it incompatible with their personal philosophies.\nIt is worth noting that Freemasonry also has its advantages, which include fostering a sense of community, promoting personal growth, and providing opportunities for philanthropy and charitable work. Ultimately, whether the disadvantages outweigh the advantages is subjective and depends on an individual's personal values and perspective.

    "question": "How do I get a smooth finishing on wooden furniture?",
    "answer": "To achieve a [LINKED_TEXT: smooth finish on wooden furniture] [URL: https://www.bergerpaints.com/products/wood-finishes/183/woodkeeper-ezee-hand-polish], here are some steps you can follow:\n Sanding: Start by sanding the wooden furniture with progressively finer sandpaper, from a coarse grit to a fine grit. This will help to remove any imperfections and create a smooth surface for the finish to adhere to.\n Wood Filler: If there are any dents or scratches in the wood, use a wood filler to fill in the gaps. After filling in the gaps, let the filler dry and sand it down until it is flush with the surface of the wood.\n Clean the surface: Clean the surface of the furniture with a clean cloth to remove any dust or debris.\n Apply the Finish: Apply a coat of wood conditioner to the furniture to help the wood absorb the finish evenly. After the conditioner has dried, apply a coat of your chosen finish with a brush, roller or spray gun, following the manufacturer's instructions. Allow the finish to dry completely before sanding again with a fine grit sandpaper.\n Reapply the Finish: After the first coat of finish has dried, reapply the finish with the same method as before. This time, sand the surface lightly between coats to create a smooth surface.\n Finishing touches: Once you have applied enough coats of finish, let it dry for at least 24 hours. Sand the surface lightly with a very fine grit sandpaper to remove any bumps or rough patches. Finally, apply a coat of wax or polish to give the furniture a shiny finish.\n Following these steps will help you achieve a smooth and flawless finish on your wooden furniture.\n"

    "question": "Is it possible, in the mathematics of our universe, to construct a coherent model for an imaginary universe with other laws of physics?",
    "answer": "Mathematics is not “of our universe”. It is universal, and exists independently of the properties of the physical universe.\n And the answer is yes. As a trivial example, consider a 2+1 dimensional Minkowski manifold. This is a model for an empty, two-dimensional universe. Very uninteresting, to be sure, but it is a coherent model for an imaginary universe with laws of physics different from ours.\n As another example, quantum field theory textbooks often start the discussion using simple scalar fields. Not because such scalar fields exist in Nature, but because their simplicity allows an introductory discussion of the techniques of the theory before moving on to more realistic models. Although they do not present it that way, such a hypothetical field could inhabit a fictitious universe, again presenting a coherent model for an imaginary universe different from ours.\n As a matter of fact, considering that physics is fundamentally about finding the mathematical model that correctly describes our universe, and that this great project is still quite far from completion, arguably the mathematics that we presently use is, in fact, a more-or-less coherent model for an imaginary universe, one that closely resembles, but is not quite identical to, our actual universe. We have yet to find that final “theory of everything” that would be a fully accurate model.\n"

Here are a few possible explanations:\n Personal Interest: The candidate may have a personal interest in taxation and finance, and thus prefer to work in the IRS. They may believe that this field offers more opportunities for specialization and advancement.\n Career Goals: The candidate may have specific career goals that align better with the IRS than the IAS. For instance, they may want to specialize in taxation or finance, or work in a particular area such as transfer pricing or international taxation.\n Work-Life Balance: The candidate may believe that the IRS offers better work-life balance than the IAS. While both services require long hours and hard work, the IRS may offer more predictable work hours and less frequent transfers.\n Recruitment Process: The candidate may have found the recruitment process for the IRS to be more transparent, fair, or efficient than that of the IAS.\n In any case, both the IAS and IRS are highly respected services in India, and the decision to choose one over the other ultimately depends on the individual's interests, goals, and priorities\n"

    "question": "What are the best color of loafers to buy that go with almost everything (jeans, chinos)?",
    "answer": "Loafers continuously cycle in and out of trendiness, but always remain a menswear staple. Over the years, loafers have become increasingly diverse and inventive, with designers pushing the boundaries of casual shoes and marrying high-fashion fearlessness with classic, comfortable style.\n Loafers are made of smooth materials like suede and leather. They’re typically available in a number of darker colors that will happily blend with a wide range of outfits and styles. Indeed, the guy to your left might be rocking penny loafers with shorts and a t-shirt while the guy on your right might be wearing tassel loafers with a linen suit.\n The main takeaway here is that loafers might be versatile enough to go with casual apparel, but they still signify heightened sartorial awareness. Socks or no socks, you want to treat your loafers as part of an overall get-up that starts at the head and ends at the footwear. It’s never really about how you wear loafers, it’s about your outfit as a whole. Black, brown, and navy blue are some of the colors which go almost on all your clothes.

    "question": "Why is there so much oil on the Gulf of Mexico?",
    "answer": "The Gulf of Mexico area started being a marine gulf about 150 million years ago, when South America drifted away from North America, living a marine basin in between, the Gulf of Mexico, as the continents moved apart from each other.\n During the early stages of this ocean, it happened several times that marine plankton proliferated so much in the sea water that the seafloor of this ocean got covered with the remains of this plankton once it died and sank to the bottom where it piled up to several tens of meters thcik. Later, these remains got covered and buried by kilometers of new mud, sand and other sediments; then, as these remains got buried, they got hotter, got cooked and then voilá, oil was generated out of these remains. This is what is called “Source Rock” in the oil industry jargon.\n There were several episodes between 150 and 70 million years ago where these remains were abundant enough to later create a lot of oil (and/or gas).\n Once generated, this oil (and/or gas) migrated upwards through the cracks of the rocks and ended filling up pores in the overlaying porous rocks, like sandstones and limestones. If enough oil was accumulated, then you have a future oilfield, ready to be found.\n That’s why there are so many oil fields in Lousiana, Mississippi, Texas, Mexico and Cuba.\n Trivia: Some of the best oilfields offshore Mexico are contained in the crushed limestone rocks left behind by the impact of the famous dinosaur-killing meteorite, which impacted on Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico 65 million years ago.\n Oil and gas fields around Gulf of Mexico, highlighted in red:\n[LINKED_TEXT: Gulf of Mexico Map Geology, Oil and Gas Fields] [URL: https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/gulf-mexico-map-geology-oil-and-gas-fields]\n"

    "question": "Can King Charles III give knighthood to anybody that he wants, or must they be British citizens and pre-approved?",
    "answer": "It depends. Certain orders of knighthood like the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, and the Royal Victorian Order are in the personal gift of the Sovereign. So, subject to the statutes of each order, the King can admit anyone he wants as a knight. The single-grade orders of the Garter and the Thistle have a maximum number of living knights, excluding members of the Royal Family and foreign members, while, in the Royal Victorian Order, only the 2 highest grades (Knight Grand Cross and Knight Commander) confer knighthood.\n Most other honours, including the Orders of the Bath, of St Michael and St George, and of the British Empire, and the title of Knight Bachelor, are awarded only on the recommendation of the British government or another Commonwealth realm government, so, in those cases, the King cannot choose whoever he wants and awards are pre-approved, for example by the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, or the Defence Secretary, who in turn follow nominations by an Honours Committee or the armed services.\n In principle, to receive a knighthood from the British monarch, one also has to be a citizen of the United Kingdom or a citizen of a Commonwealth realm whose government recognises that particular honour and allows it to be awarded to its citizens. The King can, however, bestow honorary knighthoods on foreign citizens, which happens quite frequently, but does not entitle you to be called “Sir”, nor confer any precedence in the UK. Presidents of friendly republics are normally made honorary Knights, usually Knights Grand Cross of the order of the Bath, but honorary knighthoods are also regularly conferred on foreign politicians below the rank of Head of State, philanthropists, business leaders, artists/entertainers, scientists, diplomats, sports personalities, etc.\n For the Order of the Garter specifically, there is a separate class of “Stranger Knights” which is awarded to foreigners, but normally only other European monarchs (and, more recently, also Emperors of Japan) are Stranger Knights or Ladies of the Garter. Non-European royals (with the exception of Emperors of Japan) are normally made honorary Knights in more junior orders.\n"

    "question": "What will happen to the twin flame runner if he does not do the inner healing work?",

Twin flames don’t necessarily unite in every lifetime, in fact most are here to work on their purpose and mission. They rarely have joint mission and when they do, that’s when they come together as best friends, co-workers or life partners. Most of the time, they are here to activate each other and usually the divine feminine is the one who gets awakened first by the divine masculine’s presence and is the first one to find her purpose after her healing. The divine masculine choses to move away or take the role of the runner because he sometimes has only one purpose and that is to awaken the divine feminine and then they just continue with their karmic purposes. If you are divine feminine then it’s best to bring the focus on yourself and work on your healing and your purpose and if you have a joint purpose then your divine masculine will return, otherwise he was never meant to in this lifetime.\n"

    "question": "In modern sea warfare, if a destroyer is right above a submarine, is there a chance the submarine will pass undetected?",
    "answer": "A couple considerations to this question….\nbeing too close to a ship is actually a problem… As a submarine and ship get closer to each other the noise emitting for the sub reaches a point where it in no longer a specific sound level from a specific bearing but the noise is distributed over a range of bearings… Consequently, the submarine cn ‘disappear’ as the systems processing the information now take that noise and assume it’s background. It’s called near field effect and it affects, radar , sonar, and all passive listening systems.The destroyer sonar transducers are arranged to detect ships far removed from them. The coverage does not necessarily include beneath the ship so being directly underneath may in fact be in a dead zone of the passive detection systems. Again the detectors, processors and analysis computers all are based on the sub marine being some distance away from the ship at detection which is a reasonable assumption. Justice you always assume closing when you first detect a radar or sonar contact because it’s unlikely that you are over taking another vessel.For Passive sonar, most submarines emitted noise signature is below the threshold for background noise even at close range so it’s very hard unless there is a transient - like slamming a hatch, dropping a hammer, etc to detect a submarine in general.\n"

    "question": "Why are western countries including the United States publicly stating what military equipment they are sending to Ukraine? Whatever happened to keeping the enemy in the dark of your plans? Is it just politics, hubris or stupidity?",
    "answer": "First, we need to draw a significant distinction between the US and the UK and the NATO members in eastern Europe. While the two English speaking nations routinely give detailed lists of materiel shipped to Ukraine, the eastern NATO countries do not usually specifically disclose what they are sending to Ukraine and, in some cases, even that they are shipping Ukraine additional weapons or supplies at all.\n There are several reasons for this. First, in the US and UK, the Legislature has detailed and extensive control over particular expenditures of the government. They are also very prone to leaks, giving the extensive free press and the absence of a culture of secrecy in both nations. Thus, not disclosing the nature of materiel sent directly from these countries is not particularly realistic.\n On the other hand, the eastern European NATO members were all Communist until the last 30 to 35 years. In addition, even prior to their domination by the USSR after 1945, there was a substantial disparity between the openness of governments between eastern and western European countries (including, functionally, the USA by extension). Though now democratic (to a greater or lesser extent), these countries are much more easily able to keep things quiet when they want to. In addition, they are close to Russia and more directly exposed to retaliation than the US and UK.\n There is, however, an intersection between the two approaches. One of the ways the US and western European nations have supported Ukraine have done so by financial support or material support of the eastern allies. Sometimes these arrangements become public, with the best known example being the US convincing Slovakia to send an S-300 air defense system to Ukraine by replacing it with a US supplied and manned Patriot system. The former is equipment the Ukrainians already know and can operate in the short term. The latter is a much more powerful system than the S-300, but would require at least some months of training for the Ukrainians to be able to operate. It is also likely that there are a number of instances where such arrangements that do not become public. In particular, the EU has promised vast sums of money to buy weapons for Ukraine. However, the particulars of such purchases are not readily available. It is accordingly likely that a substantial amount of EU money is going to purchase equipment from the eastern European allies or to buy them replacement equipment so that they will send Soviet made or Warsaw Pact copies of equipment that Ukraine already knows how to use.\n Thus, to some extent, these practices simply reflect different systems of government among the Allies. In addition, public announcement of armaments on the way to Ukraine buoys Ukrainain morale and, to the extent it becomes known to the Russians (not so much to the public, but to the military and civilian organs of government) depresses Russian morale.\n"

    "question": "Why did Constantine I move the capital out of Rome, but didn't change the name of the Roman Empire?",
    "answer": "People in antiquity viewed things somewhat differently to the way we do. The Romans weren’t referring to the geographic location of Rome the city when they talked about the Roman Empire- they were talking about themselves the people.\n In effect it was an empire of the people of Rome, not an empire governed physically in Rome the city (although that was also true for the early history). The physical city of Rome hadn’t even been a capital of the Empire for some time by that point, cities like Milan and Nicomedia had become more important in an administrative sense.\n This is how you get splinter empires in the crisis years still calling themselves Romans despite having refuted the authority of the central empire, as well as how you get the Byzantine Romans calling themselves Romans throughout their entire history - despite mostly having no real connection to Rome the city.\n Shifting the bulk of the administration to Constantinople (initially called ‘New Rome’ by Constantine) was a strategic and economic decision- in short it was simply a better location for the administration to operate from. This had no impact on who the Romans were as a people and therefore no change in designation was necessary- this wouldn’t even have entered their thinking.\n"

    "question": "If slavery wasn't abolished in 1865, how long do you think it would have lasted after 1865?",
    "answer": "Had Lincoln lived the lot of American blacks, while not a bed of roses would have given these people far more legal protections, but President Johnson, Lincoln’s vice president being a southerner reversed the terms of Reconstruction. It took 100 more years to even begin to return to any kind of legal action that benefited A/A.\n Fifty-five years later most black Americans have reached the middle class, though being middle class has lost significant ground since the Reagan administration. If the middle class as a whole could manage to elect a better and more progressive government and inaugurate a ‘better deal’ than we now have for both the blue and white collar working class much of that lost ground could be made up.\n If law enforcement could do something about the ‘ethnic’ drug and street gangs in certain neighborhoods in certain cities black Americans would probably surge ahead again. We all could have done better on this issue in the last 100 years, but it’s not too late…. the current GOP/Tea/Fox/Jesus party sure isn’t helping, but maybe even that might turn around after this next election cycle. Let us pray!\n"

    "question": "What is nanotechnology, and why should I care?",
    "answer": "Nanotechnology refers to the alteration and modification on the source, image, modeling or system at nanometer scale(atomic, molecular, or macromolecular size). The dimension between 1 to 100 nanometer is known as nanoscale. To understand the nanoscale, the strand of the hair is 50,000 to 100,00 nanometer.\n The effect on the nanomaterial range is much larger than the mass of the material produced in the large form. The nanotechnology gets in the core of the material as it works on atomic and molecular level changing the outcome or generating the new ones.\n Talking about the application of nanotechnology, natural carbon exists in two forms graphite and diamond. Now, according to the research done between 1985 to 2004, three different additional form of carbon nanomaterial were discovered as fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene. Graphene is known as the wonder material as it is 200 times stronger than steel.\n Today, there are no fields where nanotechnology is not applied, from large scale electronic industries to medicine, food, cosmetics, agriculture, space and aeronautics, and automotive industries. The change in the Nano level can alter and bring the solution to the various obstacles as it can impacts the material from the core. This is why all the field of science like biology, chemistry, physics, as well as astrology are keen and working on the depth and base of nanotechnology.\n"

    "question": "What are some of the accounting policy implications of the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting and justify which is more likely to be used in the preparation of financial statements in the public sector?",
    "answer": "Well, Cash Accounting is easy. When you receive cash, the Revenue is recorded. When you spend cash, the expense is recorded. There are no such things as capitalizing assets. A good example of this would be buying a car. You’re expecting to get a useful life of that car for say 10 years.\n Under the Cash system, the expense of the car would hit your books all when you bought the car. Then when you’re using that car to generate revenue (or deliver services), you’d record no expense. This makes your expenses overstated when you buy the capital asset, and then your expenses understated in subsequent years.\n Under the accrual system, you’d capitalize the cost of the car, and the depreciate that (spread the expense of that car) out for the life of the car (which you’ve determined to be 10 years.\n So, under a cash system, if the car cost $20,000, you’d book the expense of the $20,000 in year 1. Where under an accrual system, you’d book the expense of the car as depreciation expense of approx. $2,000 each year until you either disposed of it (by selling or scrapping it), or the car had depreciated to the point of being off your books.\n As far as the public section, outside of very small entities, they are required to use the accrual system.\n"

    "question": "Why are people able to get up on time and work hard for other people but struggle with doing it/working for themselves?",
    "answer": "Because, we are bad at creating rules.\n Self discipline is an extremely hard problem. Especially when you want to make the most out of your time. As [LINKED_TEXT: Awdhesh Singh (अवधेश सिंह)] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Awdhesh-Singh-1] said in his answer, we lack motivation to work for ourselves; but while working for others, we put our social status, recognition and reputation on the line. The punishment for not complying in such situations will be greater than the reward that comes with complying. This motivates us to work harder.\n Recollect that our efficiency peaks right before the deadline. Why does this happen? Notice that, it is during this time we have the least amount of freedom. So does removing one’s freedom make them work faster? Sadly, yes.\nSo why does this happen?\nThe more choices we have, or the most choices we assume ourselves to have, the greater will be the likelihood of us choosing a different and unproductive option. Less the number of options, greater will be our focus on the task at hand. Being able to autonomously restrict our options at anytime is required to stay self disciplined.\nSo how do you do this?\nThis entirely depends on the kind of habits you form over time. Try motivating yourself, for hitting your targets. Working for others always comes with some sort of motivation, which is not just restricted to the paycheck. It could be career goals, career growth, promotions (scarcely pay hike) or increased responsibilities/trusts.\nCreate a list of things you like doing. Assume, watching a movie is on the list.Fix a starting time for your work. And if required, also fix a deadline. Do this if you are sure about the amount of time you will need.Try completing your task before the allocated deadline. If there is no deadline, try measuring your progress to check if you have worked enough.If you do complete your task, reward yourself by watching a movie.If you aren’t successful in completing the task, but if you have made good progress, reward yourself with something that’s worth less than watching a movie.Follow the above steps everyday.\nEvery task pose different demands, making it hard to predict the right deadline. So even if you don’t make it past the deadline, try understanding how far you have come in finishing the task and match this with the amount of reward you receive. Or, if you think you have worked enough and made good progress, just go ahead in rewarding yourself!\nIs freedom good for productivity?\nFreedom is not good for productivity. If our employer does not restrict our freedom, it should be ourselves who restricts it. Exercising full freedom is equivalent having all the possible choices before us. This also includes the choice “do not work”. So you will have to restrict at least one choice, which is “do not work”, to start working! Every decision you make reduces your freedom. The only benefit of having freedom is, the power to restrict our own freedom.\n"

    "question": "Can AI computing break RSA encryption?",
    "answer": "Maybe?\n There is a dangerous attack on RSA using greatest common denominator (GCD) - basically, the security of RSA comes from keeping the two prime numbers that form the modulus (public key) secret; getting from the modulus to the two primes is the “hard problem” that protects RSA.\n However, if you have two modulii that have a single prime in common, it is a much easier task to find that common number (and you can then find the other just by simple division)\n There are millions of RSA keys out there; the odds are good at least one of them will have at least ONE prime in common with your own keypair, as keys with roughly the same magnitude have primes of roughly the same magnitude (and there is a strictly limited, but large, number of them)\n This is the sort of thing ML could well be good at - train it on a steady stream of modulii, and have it punch out GCD primes plus the modulii that share them.\n We don’t know, because if anyone has succeeded at this, they are not announcing it. But its certainly possible.\n"

    "question": "By what right did Sweden enter NATO without Russia's consent?",
    "answer": "Because Russian consent is not needed for any country other than Russia.\n Heck, even if the country in question did sign treaty with Russia (Or USSR) where they solemnly swear to not enter NATO (such as the Austrian neutral status was enshrined in law when the end of occupation was negotiated in the 1950s) that still does not mean they can not do it.\n Effectively all law works on the principle of “you and what army?” national law is enforceable because states usually have much greater ability to do violence onto citizen than any citizen has ability to do violence onto state.\n International law is the same.\n So, say that we do a hypothetical where Russia has some “legal right” to determine if Sweden can join NATO. It still does not matter, because when NATO asks “You and what Army?” Putin will be forced to admit that most of his army’s deplorable strength is bogged down in Ukraine. Therefore even in fantasy land where Russia can “legally” keep Nato from expansion, it does not matter what Russia wants, NATO will expand as it pleases so long as other states want to join and NATO wants to admit them.\n"

    "question": "Why is computer engineering not growing as fast as computer science?",
    "answer": "Computer hardware has to a large extent been commoditized.\n Think of chips like Intel Core CPUs and NVIDIA GeForce GPUs. These are general-purpose processing units that run on millions of computers everywhere. They can pretty much solve all of our computing needs. The cloud has accentuated this development further, because the cloud giants buy up standardized hardware in huge bulks. What we end up with are a few big players that totally dominate the hardware market.\n Software is very different. Unless we develop some utopical artificial general intelligence, it’s impossible for one computer program to satisfy all of our computing needs. In fact, we need a plethora of them on a daily basis.\n When we think of software, we tend to think of a few big tech giants and their consumer software, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Custom enterprise software alone is a trillion dollar market.\n That’s why there are more than 20 million software developers worldwide, while the number of hardware engineers is probably less than a million.\n"

    "question": "What do you think of the 3/21/22 CBC report that the NDP has agreed to keep Trudeau's Liberal Party in power until 2025?",
    "answer": "It's a very old tradition for minority Liberal governments to seek support from the NDP holding the balance of power, exchanging support against confidence votes for action on NDP policy objectives.\n It's how we got universal health care, for one thing.\n It's not surprising in the least. It's a good way for a party that has a lot of seats but essentially no feasible way to form a government to get some of its bucket list done by the party that is likely to continue to hold power (unpopular as Trudeau is, he's just the leader of the party with the most seats, and the party's approval rating is actually pretty good, all things considered).\n Historically in arrangements like this the Liberals even get to actually claim responsibility for some legitimately good progressive policy they would otherwise never have considered enacting. You should hear Chretien go on about how it was Pearson's Liberals who were responsible for the Canada Health Act…\n If the Conservatives weren't so busy imploding with QAnon nonsense and oppositional defiant disorder they could do something like this. They've always been way better at tearing down than building up, though, so they'll probably just keep doing like the Republicans and oppose everything, even the stuff they would normally do themselves, just because the Liberals are doing it. You know, stay in character.\n"

    "question": "Do aloe vera plants use the same soil type as the jade plant?",
    "answer": "The jade plant (Crassula ovata, C. argentea or C. portulacea), also known as the money or friendship plant, is prized for its succulent, oval-shaped green leaves, clusters of white flowers and a distinctive, attractive form. It is possible to grow a jade plant outdoors up to U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zone 10, but you can grow it anywhere as a houseplant and they look somewhat like bonsai trees. Choosing or preparing an appropriate soil moisture is key to avoiding problems like root rot.\n Type Of Soil That Jade Plant Use\n The only major soil\n requirement that jade plants have is that the soil\n must drain rapidly. The jade plant, native to South Africa, has adapted to thrive in rocky, sandy soil\n with low fertility. Jade plants do have a tendency to become top-heavy and their shallow roots make them prone to tipping over. A slightly heavier soil\n that contains a greater amount of organic matter better anchors the jade plant. Jade plants can grow in acidic or slightly alkaline soils but can suffer from nutrient deficiencies or toxicity in an extremely low or high soil pH.\n Despite how much aloe vera plants help sunburn, like humans, they don't actually thrive in the sun—and yes, this is the case even thought they bloom in the summertime. (Because that would just be TOO easy.) If you found yourself saying \"really?\" to these facts, then you've definitely come to the right place. It isn't actually hard to grow an aloe plant—here are the secrets to successfully getting yours going in time summer.\n Type Of Soil Aloevera Plant Use\n Because aloe vera plants are succulents, the type of soil you choose can really make or break your success. suggests a sandy soil with a neutral pH. Potting mix made for cacti and succulents is always a great choice.\n Hangouts @javaziggy\n"

    "question": "How was it that Sandy Koufax was not a unanimous selection to the Baseball Hall of Fame?",
    "answer": "Because up until just very recently, NOBODY was ever a unanimous selection to the Hall.\nBabe Ruth was not named on 11 ballots in 1936.Walter Johnson was only on 83% of the ballots of the same first ballot.More than 20 BBWAA voters did not vote for Willie Mays on his first ballotEight voters left Cal Ripken Jr. off their ballots.Tom Seaver? 5 people didn’t vote for him.Koufax himself: not even close to unanimous: 86% of the votes. There were dozens of electees who have gotten higher percentages.\nThe reasons why were usually non-baseball related bunk: some voters would purposely leave off players on their first ballots every time in protest of the legends of the game not themselves being unanimous. Other voters routinely leave off players with whom they’ve had disagreements with in the past. A slew of recent voters have sent in blank ballots in protest of the PED era, which results in a non-vote for which ever player was on that ballot at the time.\n It wasn’t until the BBWAA roster was revamped in the late 2010s and a spirit of transparency started to become more pervasive in the voter block that we started to get really close to deserved unanimous votes. And that’s when we got the first truly unanimous player in Mariano Rivera, who got 425 out of 425 in 2019.\n"

    "question": "Why has Labour lost its fourth general election in a row?",
    "answer": "The principle problem is Labour’s manifesto was set by the National Executive Committee whose views had reflected the opinions of the rank-and-file membership. Ed Milliband was keen to make Labour policy more democratic and representative of the opinions held by ordinary party members.\n There has always been a dichotomy in the Labour Party caused by what ordinary members want and support and what research shows the public will vote for in a General Election.\n After the Labour Party lost with Neil Kinnock in the 1992 election, it was realized by the National Executive Committee that Labour had to listen to what research into voting behaviour showed. In 1997, Labour ran a slick campaign under Tony Blair, arguing the country needed a more centrist government. Labour won with a landslide and won the two elections after that, but then a change of leader resulted in a change of fortunes with Labour losing again.\n There is no complicated explanation of why Labour lost - it is just that the National Executive Committee made an elementary mistake that it did not make with Tony Blair as Labour leader. What it did wrong was to ignore what they knew research into voting behaviour showed. When Labour won with a landslide, it was because it took onboard what research showed.\n"

    "question": "What is the procedure of all possible regression model selection techniques using R-square and MSE criteria? What are the advantages of one over the other?",
    "answer": "They are both related with the same measure (the sum of squared errors). MSE is used to compare nested linear models through F tests. The determination coefficient should also be only used to compare nested linear models although some ignorant persons do compare non-nested models using it…\n The advantage of using MSE over the determination coeficient is that, if the model assumptions are verified the model selection is based on a statistical test that is analizing if adding a given variable to your model results in a significant reduction of the MSE. For this reason, comparing MSE through F tests tends to give you a more parsimonious model than a determination coeficient comparison procedure, which will tend to give you an over parametrized model.\n A model selection routine is an algorithm that can use any test or criteria based rule to compare and select nested models.\n Non-nested model comparisons are usually done recurring to criteria related with the likelihood of the sample given each model. One of the most commonly used is the Akaike criteria.\n"

    "question": "Why did old airplanes use radial engines?",
    "answer": "The first advantage is that by dividing a power cycle into multiple parts, the torque output can be smoothed out. Piston engines don’t produce torque output all the time, which is why they need a flywheel to store some kinetic energy and produce a continuous output thereby. If there are many engines working alternatively, they can compensate for each other, which reduces the need for bigger flywheels and mechanical vibrations. It’s just like it’s easier to convert multiphase AC into DC due to the smaller amounts of ripple produced by multiphase rectifiers.\n  Radial engines also have a much larger cross section than inline engines, which enables them to be cooled by air alone, without the need of liquid coolant. As a result, radial engines are much more rugged against battle damages because they have no coolant to lose. The downside is that larger cross section also produces more aerodynamic drag. However, radial engines can be shrouded with aerodynamic fairings ([LINKED_TEXT: NACA cowling] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_cowling]) to reduce the drag while not compromising the cooling efficiency.\n"

    "question": "What enterprise asset management software is available?",
    "answer": "There are two approaches to enterprise asset management packages - one is to go after hardware and then discover the software installed on the hardware (ie Device 42), the other is to ignore the hardware, go after the software and then infer operating system information (ie Snow Software). Be clear about what it is that your management team is looking for because that will effect your enterprise asset management software selection and will also impact what you can do down the road.\n In addition to selecting a major asset management product, it’s a good choice to use multiple systems to source data and the overall discovery footprint - this allows more triangulation on the assets and offers a better overlay for asset discovery. If you think of it like a Venn diagram, each additional discovery source will allow you to see where you have alignment and where you do not. This is all good because you are learning and you want to discover both where the pools of assets are aligned and where they are not. Other sources to complete the asset inventory:\nInformation security scanning toolsMobile device management toolsActive Directory / Computers container\nAsset management reports are always a point in time. Assets can be offline, powered off for repairs, unavailable due to network outages - so communicate often that the reports are a point in time and subject to change. It is unlikely that you will have 100% of all assets reporting accurately at all times. Staff your organization sufficiently to troubleshoot variances over time.\n"

    "question": "What is the story behind why Canadians selected the \"loon\" to be featured on Canadian dollar coins?",
    "answer": "[LINKED_TEXT: A Tale of Two Designs: How Canada’s 1-dollar Coin Became the Loonie  | The Royal Canadian MintAffectionately dubbed the “Loonie,\" Canada's one-dollar circulation coin has become a cherished national symbol since its 1987 debut.\nTo celebrate the 35th anniversary of Canada’s golden-hued circulation coin, we revisit the story of the Voyageur design and explore the many commemorative designs that the Loonie has featured since its arrival.https://www.mint.ca/en/blog/2022-07-a-tale-of-two-designs-loonie] [URL: https://www.mint.ca/en/blog/2022-07-a-tale-of-two-designs-loonie]Here is a glance at how a common loon found a permanent place on Canada’s one-dollar coin and became the only Canadian dollar found in circulation today.\n Early 1985: Government recommends the issuance of a new one-dollar coin and the phasing out of the bank note over a three-year period.\n Early 1986: Preparations for production of the new coin and work on the new tooling (master dies) begins.\n November 1986: A courier company collects the master dies from the Mint’s facility in Ottawa but (during a snowstorm), loses track of them while on route to Winnipeg, where the coin was to be struck.\n December 1986: Search for an alternative design begins.\n January 1987: A new design of a common loon is authorized.\n June 1987: A new dollar coin (the Loonie) is launched on June 30.\n June 1988: End of distribution of the one-dollar note is announced.\n April 1989: The last one-dollar bank note is printed by the Bank of Canada.\n The coin’s design was created by Canadian wildlife artist, Robert-Ralph Carmichael and was instantly dubbed the \"Loonie.\" It’s not known who came up with the name first or why, but the nickname caught on and Canadians have been using it ever since.\n At that time, the Loonie’s official introduction into circulation signaled the most significant change to Canada’s coinage system in over 50 years, and the coin’s classic loon design remained virtually untouched up until 2012 when a new generation of one-dollar coins arrived.\n Since 2012, the Loonie now incorporates an advanced security feature (a laser mark), which can been seen above the loon in the shape of a maple leaf. Although circulation coin counterfeiting is not a problem in Canada, in a proactive move to make the coin more resistant to potential counterfeiting, the laser mark was added.\n"

    "question": "My 3-year-old insists on sleeping on the floor. Should I let him?",
    "answer": "As soon we took our eldest son out of his crib at age 2 he took to sleeping on the floor. He’d fall asleep in his bed and then migrate to the floor. Around age 4 he took to falling asleep on the floor and staying there all night.\n He did that for the better part of a year. He had a favourite Ikea carpet that he’d sleep on, but, sometimes he’d even sleep on the hardwood floor.\n During that year he also decided to stop wearing diapers at night. Needless to say there were no mattress protectors made for carpets and we no longer have that carpet :).\n At one point his younger brother spent a night or two sleeping on his own carpet. That didn’t last and he promptly went back to his own bed.\n Our eldest is now 7, sleeps in his own bed all the time, is well behaved at school and is the most well read 7 year old you’ll ever meet. He even has an order of magnitude more rhythm than both his parents when it comes to dancing! Sleeping on the floor doesn’t seem to have done any harm to his physical, intellectual or socio-emotional development.\n"

    "question": "Why is the book \"I Alone Can Fix It\" by Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker so controversial?",
    "answer": "The book is about a controversial character, Trump, about his controversial last year in office.\n “Washington Post reporters Leonnig and Rucker return with a comprehensive if stilted rundown of the tweetstorms, turf wars, denialism, and desperation that roiled the Trump administration from January 2020 to January 2021. It’s a sweeping study of bureaucratic dysfunction caused by a “poisonous, disloyal atmosphere” that engulfed the White House and federal agencies tasked with dealing with Covid-19, protests over police brutality, and the transfer of power to a Biden administration. Among the plethora of galling anecdotes, Leonnig and Rucker reveal that Trump expected the FDA to approve remdesivir as a Covid-19 treatment because Oracle founder Larry Ellison said it worked, that chief of staff Mark Meadows considered Anthony Fauci a “fearmonger” and blocked his TV appearances, and that Rudy Giuliani’s advice to Trump on election night was to “just say we won.” Unfortunately, the book’s moment-by-moment accumulation of detail grows dull at times, and the desire of Leonnig and Rucker’s largely anonymous sources to shift blame and preserve their own reputations makes it hard to parse what actually happened during controversial events such as the violent removal of protestors from Washington, D.C.’s Lafayette Square for a Trump photo op. This deeply sourced first draft of history is long on access but short on definitive insights.”\n Quoted from Book Review.\n"

    "question": "At 45, is it a right choice to migrate to Canada?",
    "answer": "The best age group to be migrating to Canada is between 18–35 since you will get full points for the same. As per the criteria you need to get 67 points based on your age, education, experience and IELTS after which only you will be eligible to be entered into the Express Entry pool system.\n Max points for age is 12 (18–35 yrs of age). For each year after 35 years of age 1 point will be deducted. So at age 45 you will get only 2 points for the age factor. For IELTS if you are scoring 6 in each band, according to Canadian level you will be awarded 4 points for each band. If your scores are 6.5 in S, W & R and 7.5 in L you will be awarded 5 points each. If your scores are 7 in S, W & R and 8 in L, you will be awarded 6 points each and and any scores above will be awarded the same 6 points each. So the maximum points given to IELTS is 24. If your spouse is writing the IELTS exam then, spouse can contribute 5 points to the overall score (maximum points awarded 5 points. min band req -5 in each)\n Regarding the experience part, if you have 1 year experience you will get 9 points, for 2 -3 years - 11 points, 4–5 yrs - 13 points, 6 or more yrs - 15 points and that’s the maximum. For Education part if you’re a PhD holder doctorate level - 25 points, For Master’s - 23 points, Two or more post secondary credentials, one of which is a 3 year or longer post secondary credential - 22 points, For Bachelor’s (3 year or longer post secondary credential)- 21 points, 2 year post secondary credential - 19 points, 1 year post secondary credential - 15 points.\n It is based on these above criterias you will be awarded points and when you add the points it has to reach the 67 point mark. If you are getting that 67 points, you will be eligible for Express Entry. Also you need to complete an Educational Credential Assessment which measures the equivalency of your education with Canadian equivalency.\n"

    "question": "What does a dog behaviorist do that a dog trainer cannot?",
    "answer": "Very likely nothing. Maybe less than nothing. Back in the day, we did not have academic degrees in animal behavior and certainly no online training certifications. Not saying that all certified behaviorists or certified trainers are phonies, but many have not trained a single dog.\n Back in the day, people knew what the trainer’s dogs were like before you trained them and what they were like afterward. They knew you or had heard of you from people they trusted. They may have come to know the dog you trained. It was that simple. You saw the results and you liked them or you didn’t.\n Now, we have the complication of people who have an advanced degree in behavior, which they acquired from some books, inside a classroom. Or some letters after their name which they acquired in an online course. They don’t even have to have a dog.\n Lastly, the most important thing to remember in the dog world is that a veterinarian is not a trainer and a trainer is not a vet, and a rescue manager is neither. Nor is a breeder. Also, an agility trainer is not a trainer for reactive dogs; a competition obedience trainer is neither.\n"

    "question": "Magnesium and helium have zero electron affinity but calcium don’t. Why?",
    "answer": "the energy change that occurs when a neutral atom gains an electron to form a negatively charged ion. In general, the electron affinity of an element depends on its atomic structure, including its number of electrons and the arrangement of those electrons.\n Magnesium and helium have a stable electronic configuration with a full valence shell, which means they have a low tendency to gain an additional electron. This is because their valence shells are already complete with two and eight electrons, respectively. Therefore, they have zero electron affinity.\n Calcium, on the other hand, has an electronic configuration of 2,8,8,2, which means it has two valence electrons that can be gained to achieve a stable electronic configuration with a full valence shell of 2,8,8. This makes calcium more likely to gain an electron, which results in a negative electron affinity.\n In summary, the differences in the electronic configurations of these elements determine their tendency to gain an additional electron and therefore, their electron affinity.\n"

    "question": "What happened to the Borg that they are no longer a threat to the Federation in Star Trek?",
    "answer": "In the Star Trek universe, the Borg are a powerful cybernetic species that assimilate other cultures and technologies to add to their own collective consciousness. The Borg were first encountered by the Federation in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"Q Who?\" and became a recurring threat throughout the franchise.\n Throughout the series, the Federation and its allies fought several battles against the Borg, including the Battle of Wolf 359 and the Battle of Sector 001. These conflicts resulted in significant casualties and damage to Federation ships and stations.\n However, over time, the Federation developed new technologies and tactics to combat the Borg, including the use of deflector shields modified to emit a specific frequency that disrupts the Borg's ability to adapt to Federation weapons. In addition, the Federation formed alliances with other species, such as the Klingons, to fight the Borg together.\n One of the most significant events in the defeat of the Borg was the destruction of the Borg Queen in the movie Star Trek: Nemesis. Without the Queen to coordinate their actions, the Borg were severely weakened and no longer posed a significant threat to the Federation.\n Overall, through a combination of advanced technologies, strategic alliances, and the elimination of the Borg Queen, the Federation was able to neutralize the Borg threat and prevent them from posing a significant danger to the galaxy\n"

    "question": "Can ayone tell me about the Hashish? What is Hashish and Hashish History?",
    "answer": "Hashish, also known as hash, is a concentrated form of cannabis that has been used for various purposes throughout history. It is made by extracting resin from the trichomes of the Cannabis plant, which are small glandular structures that contain cannabinoids, such as THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol). The extracted resin is then usually compressed into a solid block or paste-like substance, which can be smoked, vaporized, or used in other forms for recreational or medicinal purposes.\n The use of hashish dates back thousands of years and has been documented in different cultures around the world. Here's a brief overview of hashish's history:\nAncient origins: Hashish use can be traced back to ancient civilizations, such as in China, India, and the Middle East, where it was used for medicinal, religious, and recreational purposes. There are references to hashish in ancient Chinese texts, Indian Ayurvedic texts, and Islamic literature, dating as far back as 2000 BCE.Middle Ages: Hashish use spread to the Middle East and North Africa during the medieval period, where it was used by Sufi mystics for its potential psychoactive effects in religious and mystical practices. It was also used for recreational purposes and became associated with leisure and pleasure.European influence: Hashish was introduced to Europe by travelers and traders during the 19th century and gained popularity among artists, writers, and intellectuals who were fascinated by its effects and associations with exoticism and oriental culture. It was also used as a medicinal remedy for various ailments.20th century: Hashish and cannabis in general faced increased regulation and prohibition in many countries during the 20th century, driven by changing social and political attitudes, concerns about drug abuse and addiction, and international drug control treaties. Despite this, hashish continued to be used recreationally, medicinally, and for spiritual or cultural purposes in different parts of the world.Modern era: In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the potential medicinal properties of cannabinoids found in hashish, such as THC and CBD, leading to the legalization or decriminalization of cannabis in some countries and states for medicinal or recreational use. However, hashish and cannabis continue to be regulated substances in many jurisdictions, and the legal status and attitudes towards hashish vary widely around the world.\nIn summary, hashish has a long history of use for medicinal, religious, and recreational purposes, and its cultural significance and legal status have evolved over time in different regions. It continues to be a topic of interest, debate, and regulation in contemporary society. [LINKED_TEXT: Buy Hash online Canada] [URL: https://topbcbuds.cc/product-category/concentrates/hash/].\n"

    "question": "Can we agree that the Urdu language is the original Hindi language?",
    "answer": "Standard Hindi does indeed derive from Standard Urdu!\n Standard Hindi was born out of the Hindi movement in colonial India (19th century), spearheaded by the Brahmin classes which sought to replace Persian or Arabic origin words with Sanskrit borrowings.\n That said, all of the proponents of Hindi were well-versed in Urdu, and you can even find many traces of this history in Standard Hindi today. Some of these traces include:\n • Spoken Hindi/Hindustani (not the dialects subsumed under Hindi such as Bhojpuri and Awadhi) is closer to Standard Urdu than it is Standard Hindi\n • Hindi orthography (in Devanagari) reflects certain conventions that make more sense in the Nastaliq script, but owing to the fact that the first Hindi writers were originally Urdu writers, such conventions carried through (ex. गहरा instead of गेहरा, वह instead of वोह)\n • Sanskrit noun borrowings use the same gender their Persian or Arabic origin equivalents use in Urdu (ex. the borrowing ‘Rashtra’ (state) is feminine, as is ‘Riyasat’)\n • Standard Urdu is intelligible to Hindi speakers while Standard Hindi is generally not intelligible to Urdu speakers\n Hope this helps!\n"

    "question": "What large predators still live in Europe?",
    "answer": "– Wolves.\nAfter a time in which wolves went (almost) completely extinct throughout most of Europe due to over-hunting and conflicts with farmers, eventually conservation efforts prevented the species from reaching total extinction, reintroduced captive individuals to most remote regions (like Mercantour National Park, in southwestern France), and protected these wolves so well that their populations rebounded for the first time since the 18th century, rising to around 12,000–30,000 individuals or more, and recolonizing all of their historical ranges (including the woods surrounding Paris).\n – Lynxes.\nToday, there are no lions nor tigers in Europe, so another feline has come to fill the void: it’s the Eurasian lynx, the largest of all lynx subspecies (around 18–30 kg). Despite their vulnerability to deforestation, conflicts with farmers and poaching, Eurasian lynxes still have a wide range and a stable population of around 8,000–30,000 individuals living in the forests of Western Europe (including Spain and France), all the way to Russia.\n – Brown bears.\nBrown bears were once distributed throughout Europe, but pressure from over-hunting and habitat loss reduced their range and populations drastically – in France and Spain, the species is only found in the Pyrénées mountain range (around 30–250 individuals), but even in this stronghold, bears remain greatly threatened because of poaching and ever-increasing conflicts with farmers, as well as the locals’ lack of will to protect them. As such, bears face an uncertain future in Western Europe.\nOn the other hand, bears are faring rather well in Eastern Europe, rising to around 500–5,000 individuals that thrive in their forest ranges thanks to heavy conservation efforts – and these populations are only increasing nowadays.\nIt is worthy to note that all these three predators are still found in mainland Europe (including Spain, France, Italy, Germany and Poland among others), but not in the United Kingdom, where wolves, bears and lynxes remain absent since the 16th century; however, reintroduction projects are in talks of being arranged.\n"

The main theme is that you have Magistrates and Crown Courts for criminal and then County Court for lower civil orders and claims. This often means that the same people will meet the same judge, clerk of the court or magistrates on their various visits.\n For the magistrates courts, there are frequent lawyers who pretty much fund their life from public defence work. Some of these people are reconciled to the general idea that most of their work is going to be empty and hollow, so they don’t put in much effort and are happy to get the cheque at the end of the day. What often happens is that some of these same lawyers then see the golden gate of civil litigation open every so often. They will jump at the chance of spending several days on one client rather than several clients on one day. These lawyers are the open mike nights of the court circuit. They are not rehearsed and they certainly are not funny.\n Judges can be very variable in their mood and handling of the hearing. If you know which judge you are seeing, you get a good idea of how a bad lawyer will get treated. This can often go sour for the party they are representing. Any hole in court procedure will get picked up by the other party’s representative(s). That then does not always go into the case being swung in their favour, but it will to costs. If a case is rushed to court, without following all the steps, it could end up with the bad lawyer winning the case, but his client paying all the costs in the case.\n Judges tend to have a pathological hatred of time wasters and incompetence. In that small cluster of court facilities there are often offices for the prosecutors and also duty lawyers for defence. They know each other and it can often be a premonition of success in the case, either by skill or the usual choice of client.\n"

    "answer": "Nothing adds up in the initial stages of any mishap investigation. We must wait until the investigators complete their work and release their report to find out how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together.\n That said, we can’t help but speculate, and one factor that may play an important role is that the company that owned the helicopter did not have FAA certification for the company’s pilots to fly under instrument flight rules. They were and are required to fly only under visual flight rules, meaning they can’t fly in fog or in any conditions where they can’t see the airspace around them.\n [LINKED_TEXT: Helicopter in Kobe Bryant Crash Wasn’t Legal to Fly in Poor Visibility] [URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/us/kobe-bryant-crash-flight-certification.html?login=smartlock&auth=login-smartlock]\n The pilot had the skills to fly IFR, but he wasn’t allowed to do so, even though the helicopter had the instruments to allow IFR flight. This doesn’t mean that the crash was his fault; after all, he knew how to use the instruments to fly in poor visibility. But regardless of what actually caused the mishap, the pilot’s choice to fly in the fog will be a contributing factor. What we don’t yet know is how that choice contributed to the mishap.\n"

    "question": "Who is the best actor in your opinion, Sushant Singh Rajput or Salman Khan?",
    "answer": "Most STARS like SALMAN are only STARS and not the ACTORS. SUSHANT was an actor!!!!\n Stars like Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan do same things in all the films. They will walk, talk, laugh, eat, speak, look as they do in their real lives. These people never follow the demand of the character in a film, they do the same thing in every film. People like the way Shahrukh spread his arms or stutter while speaking a line and he will do this in every film, no matter his character is a cop or a thief.\n But Sushant is an actor. He started as a background dancer, then he did TV and then films. He worked with director Abhishek Kapoor in his first film as Ishan, an emotional, hardworking and a little stubborn boy who refuses even the financial help of his father.\nIn M.S. Dhoni, Sushant did a wonderful job. He was so much inside the skin of the character that people felt that they are watching the real Dhoni on the big screen. Remember, Dhoni is a popular personality and everyone has seen him several times and thus adopting his body language on the big screen was a real challenge but Sushant did it successfully.\nWithout a second thought, in terms of acting skill, Sushant is better to Salman Khan.\n"

    "question": "How would you rank these 3 shinobi by their body flicker speed: Shisui, Minato, Tobirama?",
    "answer": "Shisui's body flicker seemed impressive because of the afterimages he left.\n But afterimages are a result of an image that continues to appear in one's vision after the exposure to the original image has ceased. And this is only because the vision is lacking in reflex.\n To most shinobi, shisui might create afterimages, but to people with superior reflexes only see a one shisui running around.\n Minato and tobirama are considered the fastest shinobi in their Era, and this isn't because of teleportation and Ay knows that. When considering speed, reflexes and reaction play an important factor, and chakra control and volume makes it all possible.\n The body flicker is a D rank jutsu, which involves high speed movement with the help of Chakra. Not suitable for fights due to inability to effectively use it for the lack of reflexes and better reactions, a case similar to Kakashi's chidori, tunnel vision.\n For speed freaks like Minato and tobirama who use ftg, shisui might as well be a snail.\n Minato was almost toying with A, who has a combination of enhanced reflexes and reaction than even sasuke’s sharingan, lightning armor and a body flicker at its top.\nAnd we all know, shisui isn't as fast as A at all.\n The fastest one with a body flicker is Minato, Tobirama gave his blessing too.\n Secong is the second hokage Tobirama.\n Third is Shisui, and there a lot of people before him who have greater speed feats\n"

The war adds to the risks to a timeline that is already suffering.\n In addition to these legitimate and non-political reasons for dropping the Russian nuclear alternative, the Finns were looking for a way to get the Russians out of the project. There were threats to the construction permits (which may or may not have been grounded in law) and significant public and political pressure to keep the Russians out of critical infrastructure projects.\n “Fennovoima’s board saw no other option than to terminate the contract,” Chairman Esa Harmala said at a press conference. “This decision was not taken because of the war” but “because of delays and an inability to deliver, and we have seen the war added to these risks.” [LINKED_TEXT: Finland Drops Nuclear Plant Deal With Russian Energy Company (2)] [URL: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-02/finland-s-fennovoima-terminates-rosatom-nuclear-plant-contract-l2oe3k2j]\n Thanks for the A2A.\n"

    "question": "How did Alexander the Great leave such a lasting effect on the civilization of the Mediterranean, Egypt, and near East even though he swept through the area extremely quickly in only a few years?",
    "answer": "Alexander the Great's conquest of the Persian Empire was really more of a hostile take over than a revolution. He basically went from satrapy to another and replaced the satraps, in some cases he even left the same satrap in power and just made them swear allegiance to him. Aside from that he mostly left the old Persian system of autonomy in place. He didn't drastically change the laws, administration, taxation, bureaucracy etc. So his empire mostly hummed along as before just with new management.\n The big changes that did occur occurred after his death, when his generals divided the empire up between themselves and so had to develop some new institutions. The most drastic being in Egypt, where the Ptolemies actively integrated themselves into the Egyptian political and religious system while also creating new Greco-Egyptian gods like Serapis.\n Outside of Egypt though the most lasting aspect of the Hellenistic period was mostly artistic. From modern India to modern Turkey you can see examples of Hellenistic influence on the local cultures, like these busts of Alexander the Great and Buddha respectively:\n Names also left some influence, Iskander, a Persianised form of Alexander, is a common name in the Middle East and South Asia today, and there are still a few “Iskandaryias\" around Asia.\n There was also some residual influence on Jewish culture. The story of Gog and Magog from the Bible talks about how Alexander the Great built a gate in the Caucasus to keep out the demons of the Steppe (ie. Scythians and Turkic horse nomads).\n But apart from that the Hellenistic influence on the East wasn't all that strong.\n"

    "question": "What is TM (transcendental meditation) all about, making money? I know they charge for instruction.",
    "answer": "Transcendental Meditation (TM) is a specific technique of meditation that involves the use of a mantra, which is a sound or word repeated silently to oneself. TM is often associated with the teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who introduced the technique to the western world in the 1950s.\n While TM does charge for instruction, it is not solely focused on making money. The fees charged by TM are used to cover the costs of training and supporting teachers, as well as funding research and outreach programs.\n TM has been the subject of numerous scientific studies, and there is evidence to suggest that it may have various benefits for mental and physical health, including reducing stress, anxiety, and depression, improving focus and concentration, and lowering blood pressure.\n While some critics argue that the fees charged by TM are too high, proponents argue that the benefits of the practice justify the cost. Ultimately, the decision to pursue TM or any other form of meditation is a personal one, and individuals should carefully consider the costs and benefits before deciding to invest in instruction.\n"

    "question": "Do many Americans want to decide the Presidency directly, rather than by using the electoral college? I understand the historical reasons for an electoral college but communication systems are now much better!",
    "answer": "The only Americans that want this are die-hard Democrats.\n The problem with it is that if we had this then the only votes that matter are going to be people in giant states like California, Texas, and Florida. Billy Joe Bob in Alabama’s opinion won’t matter.\n This is exactly what the Founding Fathers did not want. The United States is not a democracy and it’s not supposed to be. Technically, you are a citizen of your state and not of the United States. While we all call ourselves Americans, you’re supposed to be a Californian, a Texan, a New Yorker, etc.\n Because of this, it’s the state that elects the President, not the people. Technically, if your state told you to go pound sand and that the governor alone will cast the ballot for the entire state that’s actually allowed. None of them actually do this of course but it’s not unconstitutional. The reason for this is not because communication methods in the 18th century were not good, the reason is that the founders didn’t want a situation where the citizens of one gigantic state would dictate the policy for the entire country.\n"

    "question": "Why do masons show up in a brother's funeral? Can they be asked no to if it would upset relatives?",
    "answer": "Masons show up at a Brother’s funeral out of respect for the family and his contributions to his lodge and the community. When a member dies, it is usually the Worshipful Master of the lodge or another member of the lodge he was close to that contacts the family and sees if there is anything they can do to help the family out during that sorrowful time. At that point, they will ask the family if they would like the Masonic lodge to help out with the funeral services and offer a Tribute of Affection to the deceased worthy Brother. Usually that person will have made known whether they would like the Masonic funeral ceremony at their funeral service before passing away. If not, it is the family’s decision as to whether they would like that, and the local lodge and Brother Masons around will show up in white gloves and aprons and perform the ceremony at the appropriate time.\n If it would upset relatives, the family might decide not to have those services included in the funeral services. If it is the family’s desire to include the services, then those relatives that would be upset have a choice to attend or not. The lodge should never try to persuade or push the services on the family. Not sure why individuals would be upset other than they completely misunderstand Freemasonry and attribute negative connotations to it that if they did a little research would find out that all the anti-Masonic literature out there has been debunked, but continues to be spread around within certain zealot circles. If you are curious about the Masonic funeral services honoring a deceased Brother, contact your local lodge and they will let you read it, then you can decide if it is something you want to include or not. Having performed this many times, the comments from family and friends attending the funeral services really appreciate the compassionate and caring wording of the Tribute of Affection and shows them the aspect of Brotherly Love we have among members.\n"

    "answer": "Hello there, Boruch! Thanks for the A2A.\n This is coming straight from Star Wars Fandom:\nSith troopers were elite soldiers in an army raised on the planet Exegol by the Sith Eternal—Sith cultists who revered the dark side of the Force and were devoted to the Sith religion. Though they were not imbued with the power of the Force, Sith troopers nonetheless shared the name of the revived sect of the dark side, drawing inspiration from a dark and ancient legacy. As such, their red armor was reminiscent of Sith lightsaber blades and the Imperial elite, evoking an aura of fear and death. They were the culmination of an elaborate contingency meant to ensure the eternal reign of a new Sith Empire, returning the galaxy to a dark age of a thousand years past.Sith troopers were fanatically loyal to the Sith cause, surpassing their predecessors in allegiance and obedience as a result of methods built upon and advanced beyond the Kaminoan procedures that trained the Republic's clone army. The best of the Sith troopers were elevated to the rank of Sovereign Protector, forming a cohort of royal guards stationed in the Sith Citadel and the amphitheater housing the Throne of the Sith.

    "question": "Should I repair my own rental properties or hire a contractor?",
    "answer": "If you have to ask the question, that is an indication you need to hire someone else.\n The decision on an individual repair or improvement depends on your skills, qualifications and building codes. If code requires a licensed contractor (which is only HVAC, electrical and plumbing in Texas and NOTHING ELSE) then if you need repairs in one of those specialty fields and are not licensed you would be a fool to fix it yourself due to liability issues if a mistake on your part were to cause physical damage to a tenant. If it’s something like a leaking pipe, it generally does not require a license to repair/replace that so you can do that yourself.\n If the repair is not something in a specialty that requires licensing then the question remains whether you have the skills, tools, time and how rapidly the item needs repaired for the safety of the tenant. If you have the skills, tools, time and can get to it timely - then go ahead. If you don’t, hire someone to get the repair fixed in a timely manner.\n Remember your tenant is your customer and they judge you as a landlord on whether you keep their unit maintained and how rapidly you get their problems resolved. That may make a difference on lease renewals and when you increase the rent on whether they choose to stay or leave.\n"

    "question": "What is it like raising a very high IQ child?",
    "answer": "It is hard, because every parent wants to have a special kid. Therefore nobody will belive until they realize it by them self.\n You have to fight for it constantly. For instance when they are 6, some social behaviours are not yet developed. People have difficulties to understand that a kid who reads thick books can at the same time be 6 year old kids who is afraid of the dark and needs mom or dad to go to kindergarden. Or empathy is not yet developed.\n When they enter school they start learning A for a week then B and so on. This drives them absolutely nuts because thats what they did with 2, by them self.\n But the teachers only sees that the handwriting is bad, so he has to write A for weeks. If nothing happends and the kid gets no brain food it will start to behave accordingly. There is a video from vsauce which shows that boredom is worse than pain for humans. So if you don‘t fight at this time it would probably get some drugs.\n There is also the problem that in such schools they don‘t learn to do difficult stuff. So they don‘t learn to put extra effort into something. Eventually they give up if they cannot solve a problem imideately. They have never had to learn they only had to think. They don‘t learn to break down a problem, because the school problems are always obvious to them\n Thats school.\n At home is challenging too, they need constant brain food. They constantly talk and constantly challege your decision and mostly they are right :).\n You have to take care that you don‘t fall into the trap, that you say: common you are clever, you can do this. Because many time it‘s not about intelligence. Its about relationship and they need to know that you are there for them.\n Last but not least, it is a gift.\n"

    "question": "If there is no atmosphere in space, why is it cold?",
    "answer": "Because our language evolved before we knew much about how the world works.\n All objects radiate infrared energy all the time. On Earth, we seldom notice this because in most situations, this is a small flow of energy compared to the energy we exchange with the air and water around us by direct physical contact. Because of this, we mostly only notice infrared radiation when we are near a strong heat source—like a fire. A fire can obviously burn you by direct contact, but a hot enough fire (or space heater) can burn you just by being close—by irradiating you with strong infrared.\n Space is not cold in the sense of a brisk Siberian winter’s morn, where -100 F winds actively leach heat from the body and carry it away to Norilsk. No, space is cold in the sense of being the opposite of a space heater (no pun indended). Space is an inexhaustible heat sink.\n An object in space radiates heat away just like you are doing right now. But there is no air to be warmed by that infrared, so that energy is just gone. Unless near a star, any object will continue radiating energy away until it (the object) is very, very cold indeed.\n Near the Earth, space isn’t really cold. An object in space will heat up on its sunlit side by about the same amount it cools on the shady side. As long as the object rotates or has some flow of air or water within it, it will maintain a fairly Earth-like temperature—no problem. But otherwise, the sunlit side will get hot and the shaded side will get cold. Space itself, however, cannot have a temperature in this sense—only an energy density or radiant flux density.\n"

    "answer": "Becoming an official novelist and getting your novel published can be a challenging process, but it's not impossible. Here are some steps you can take to increase your chances of success:\nWrite your novel: This may seem obvious, but the first step to becoming an official novelist is to actually write your novel. It's important to put in the time and effort to create a well-written, compelling story that will capture the attention of readers and publishers.Revise and edit: Once you've finished your novel, it's important to revise and edit it thoroughly. This will help to ensure that your story is polished and ready for publication.Research agents and publishers: Find out which agents and publishers are looking for novels in your genre. Look for those that are accepting unsolicited submissions and check their guidelines for submission requirements.Query agents and publishers: Reach out to agents and publishers by sending them a query letter that includes a brief summary of your novel, your background and publishing history, and a sample of your writing (usually the first chapter of your novel).Be patient: Getting a novel published can be a long process. It may take a while to find the right agent or publisher, and even after you've found one, it can take several months or even years for your novel to be published.Network: Attend writing conferences, join writing groups and organizations, and engage with other writers online to build connections and learn more about the publishing industry.Self-publishing: If you are not able to find a traditional publisher, self-publishing is an option. Self-publishing platforms such as [LINKED_TEXT: Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing] [URL: https://amzn.to/3XItMe5] and Smashwords allow you to publish your book and make it available to readers worldwide.Keep writing: Even if your first novel isn't accepted by a publisher, continue to write and improve your craft. Many successful authors have had multiple rejections before getting their work published. Keep writing and honing your skills, and don't give up on your dream of becoming an official novelist.\nIt's also important to keep in mind that getting a novel published doesn't necessarily mean that you will become a best-selling author overnight. It takes hard work, persistence, and a bit of luck to become successful in the publishing industry. But with dedication and perseverance, you can increase your chances of getting your novel published and becoming an official novelist.\n"

Then you could create a 4K timeline , edit your video clips into it, resize the clips to fit the new 4K size and export.\n This would “work,” but it probably wouldn’t give you the results you’re looking for because:\nstandard definition digital video resolution was 640x480 pixels4K video resolution is 3840x2160 (a 4K TV)your video will end up looking like a blocky, blotchy, pixelated mess because there just isn’t enough information in your image to blow it up that big with good resultsnevertheless, the resulting image would be 4K“up-rezzing,” meaning having a decent image at the end of the process through complex processing won’t get you thereif your original video is HD, however, your resulting video will look a lot better—so, the less you have to blow up the image the better the resulting qualitybut it still won’t look like a true 4K image (one filmed that way at that pixel resolution)\n"

    "question": "What is the practical value of the bottom number in a time signature? I get the top number intuitively but the bottom number remains a mystery to me as a decent guitarist of 25 years only now trying to learn theory.",
    "answer": "Adding to Hal’s answer,\n4/4 means that there are 4 beats to each bar, and that a 1/4 note (the black golf club with no flag) is one beat. Most rock songs are like this.3/4 means that there are 3 beats to each bar, and that a 1/4 note (the black golf club with no flag) is one beat. This is a waltz.2/4 means that there are 2 beats to each bar, and that a 1/4 note (the black golf club with no flag) is one beat. You might hear some old songs like this.6/8 means that there are 6 beats to each bar, and that a 1/8 note (the black golf club with one flag) is one beat. The feel for this is actually like two beats per bar, where each beat feels like a triple. The Washington Post march is a tune like that.12/8 means that there are 12 beats to each bar, and that a 1/8 note (the black golf club with one flag) is one beat. The feel is four beats per bar, with each felt beat being a triplet or a shuffle. Sweet Home Chicago is an example.\nThe top and bottom numerals work together to create a meaning for the player. They see 12/8, and immediately know the tune is probably a blues shuffle.\n It might seem confusing that an eighth note is called a “beat” in 12/8, while we actually feel four beats per bar, not 12. Would it make more sense to write the time sig as 4/4 to nail the tempo, and write the twelve eighth notes as triplets? No, because triplets take a bit longer to read, with the little 3 and the tied bar over the triplet: imagine a whole chart filled with triplets. So writing 12/8 is cleaner over the whole chart.\n"

    "question": "Why are HDMI cords so expensive?",
    "answer": "It’s a legacy of the HiFi days, way back when people played vinyl records and used valves in amplifiers (Some still do) ANALOG ruled and it relied on everything being perfect - right down to the copper in the speaker cables - people were more than willing to pay very silly money to achieve perfect audio and cables played a massive part in that. When everything went digital - all that required perfection went out the window, in fact people realised that it’s the imperfection of Vinyl that makes it so attractive. If it’s too perfect it sounds false.\n So all of a sudden damp string was almost good enough. You certainly don’t need to spend a lot of cash (unless it’s for power transfer - decent copper still has it’s place - but it’s not in the firing line now)\n The only link in the jigsaw that is the same is the speaker or headset. Manufacturer’s who had been charging incredible prices on monday were faced with 99% reductions on tuesday - somehow they “forgot” to tell their customers about the new requirements. They still pushed the pure gold cables and king’s ransom prices.\n"

    "question": "Why does it seem so many foreigners, particularly those of Asian decent, own nail salons? Does the career have a particular meaning to them?",
    "answer": "For the unknowns, this is a very lucrative business with a very little upfront cost. All it takes is a little skill set which fits the Vietnamese very well. Being petite, most Viets are ill-suited for manual labor jobs that other races would go for. The only downside of the nail business is the smell of the solution which is known to have cause cancer (please double check on that). What else can you do being a relative newcomer that generates thousands of $$$ per month?\n Most of these people still have relatives back in VN in need of help. So instead of hitting the books like most other East Asians who came here with a totally different set of circumstances, these new Viet immigrants hit the nail salons. They work there for a few years, save enough $$ to open their own shops. That’s why you see them multiply like rabbits across the US. California and Texas are too competitive for business, so they move to states that have virtually no competition. They tend to go into communities with virtually no Asians to avoid competition as the natives love their meticulous works. In such states, one can make as much as 5K/month. There are ads in VN newspapers recruiting newcomers to faraway states with guaranteed salaries of 3K/month with room and board paid. Being thrifty as most of them are, they save about 80% of that.\n Most other Asian ethnics turn up their noses to these people thinking it’s remedial works that they won’t do. Remedial works…Yup.. certainly. But the cash outweighs a lot of career paths. More importantly, they don’t have the student loans. A lot of people don’t know the real story behind it. More often than not, you're not flooded with cash as they do.\n This guy below basically corners the US nail market by teaming up with Walmart.

    "question": "Why is the researcher the instrument in qualitative research?",
    "answer": "In qualitative research, the researcher is often considered the instrument because they play a crucial role in collecting, interpreting, and analyzing the data. Here are a few reasons why the researcher is seen as the instrument in qualitative research:\n 1. Subjectivity and Interpretation: In qualitative research, the focus is on understanding and interpreting subjective experiences, meanings, and social phenomena. The researcher's personal characteristics, experiences, and perspectives inevitably influence the data collection and analysis process. Researchers bring their own subjectivity and interpretive lens to the study, shaping how they observe, ask questions, and make sense of the data.\n 2. Data Collection: Qualitative research often involves methods such as interviews, observations, and focus groups, where the researcher interacts directly with participants. The way the researcher asks questions, probes for further information, and engages with participants can impact the depth and quality of the data collected. The researcher's interpersonal skills, cultural sensitivity, and ability to establish rapport play a significant role in gathering rich and insightful data.\n 3. Reflexivity and Positionality: Researchers in qualitative studies are encouraged to reflect on their own biases, assumptions, and preconceptions that might influence the research process and findings. Acknowledging their positionality and actively considering how their background and beliefs shape their understanding of the research topic is essential. This reflexivity allows researchers to be aware of their potential impact on the research and to address any biases that may arise.\n 4. Data Analysis: Analyzing qualitative data involves the researcher engaging in the process of coding, categorizing, and identifying themes or patterns. The interpretation and meaning-making of the data are highly dependent on the researcher's insights, theoretical perspectives, and analytical skills. The researcher's ability to recognize nuances, make connections, and draw meaningful conclusions from the data is integral to the research outcomes.\n It is important for researchers to be transparent about their role as the instrument and to provide a clear account of their own background, biases, and reflections in the research process. This enhances the credibility and trustworthiness of the research findings and allows for critical evaluation of the researcher's influence on the study.\n"

    "question": "How can one become an expert in CFD?",
    "answer": "CFD is hard to do well and easy to do badly. Expertise is gained by running many cases and checking the quality of those cases religiously.\n Gain experience quickly, set cases up carefully and then scrutinize the results even more carefully. As you set up the case, make mental notes on the choices you make and such as grid clustering and turbulence models. Run several cases varying these choices and look at the effect on the flow solution. Ask others how they make these choices. \n Run validation cases regularly and prove to yourself that you are making good choices. Run numerical tests varying aspects of the case set up and compare them to the validation cases. Learn what becomes a big mistake and what has little or no effect. \n Compare flow solvers. Some require more grid in the boundary layer. Some are less robust to skewed cells. Some add too much artificial dissipation. \n Run grid resolution studies on predominant flow features such as jets and recirculation regions. Look at how the flow solution changes with additional grid. \n Learn many tools and know what each does well and what each does badly. Don't ever hesitate to try a new tool or re-evaluate an older tool (that's been improved by the developer). Talk to the developers. Find out what they think is important and why they made the choices they did.\n Learn what's in the solver. While you don't need to know how to program a solver from scratch, have some idea what the different choices actually mean from a solver point of view.\n Network with other CFD people and developers and find out what others know. Develop long term relationships in the CFD community so you know who to ask for help when you need it. There is a lot of knowledge that doesn't get written down in conference papers and books. The best applied CFDers are often the quiet people who are not out spoken. Find them and talk to them.\n Finally, CFD is hard to get right because there are so many details. Take care with the details. Take care that the case is converged and that the grid was good. Be willing to rerun a case again and again until you have the details right.\n Do these things for about 5 years and you'll be a CFD expert.\n"

    "answer": "Dr. Ambedkar had long decided to change his religion to escape what he considered a “threat to freedom” – the varna or caste system, propagated by Hinduism. Frustrated by what he believed was an inherent part of the Hindu religion, Ambedkar opined that conversion was the only method for Dalits to denounce the caste system.\n Almost 20 years before he actually converted, Ambedkar addressed the Mahars – a section of the community considered untouchable – in Mumbai, apprising them of his decision to convert. In a lengthy yet heavily influential [LINKED_TEXT: speech] [URL: http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_salvation.html#2], Ambedkar urged:\n “… religion is for man and not man for religion. For getting human treatment, convert yourselves. Convert for getting organised. Convert for becoming strong. Convert for securing equality. Convert for getting liberty.”\n And although Ambedkar did not live long enough to practice a religion he so-well espoused – dying only two months after his official conversion – he led several thousands to adopt his re-interpretation of the religion.\n In fact, Deekshabhoomi in Nagpur, the site where Ambedkar led the 1956 mass conversion, remains a sacred shrine for Navayana Buddhism, and is of special significance to millions.\n"

    "question": "Did China have no choice but to implement the One Child Policy? What would have happened if China's population was allowed to grow unabated?",
    "answer": "It’s not clear, to be honest.\n It was fashionable for developing countries in the late 20th century to deliberately reduce the fertility rate. China stands out for the brutal manner it executes the policy, not for having such policy in the first place. Many countries seem to regret it today.\n An imporant idea behind the fertility reduction is to ensure that each child can get a lot of human capital investment. That said, population growth, if managed well, is a source of economic growth too. Besides that, human capital investment on girls also reduces fertility rate (because women have better things to do than to get impregnated repeatedly). The latter is the one of the reasons most developed countries have a low fertility rate.\n Another important idea behind the fertility reduction is resource limitation. However, this conveniently ignores human innovation. There are more humans today than at any other time in history, yet instead of starving we are threatened by obesity, thanks to innovations and market reorganization of agriculture.\n What would happen if there were no One Child Policy? Most likely the fertility rate would decline, anyway. As women get more options in their life and the value of human capital investment outgrows the value of raw brawn, while parents’ time became more precious, most likely people would have less children anyway. The rate drop would likely be less drastic, though.\n"

    "question": "Why did Sachin Tendulkar refuse the blank check offer from tobacco companies for endorsing products?",
    "answer": "Why did Sachin Tendulkar refuse the blank check offer from tobacco companies for endorsing products?\n Sachin Tendulkar, the legendary Indian cricketer, refused the blank check offer from tobacco companies for endorsing products because he did not want to be associated with a product that could harm people's health. Tobacco products are known to cause serious health problems, including cancer, and Tendulkar did not want to promote a product that could have a negative impact on the health of his fans and followers.\n In fact, Tendulkar has been known for his commitment to promoting a healthy lifestyle and has been associated with campaigns that promote physical fitness, healthy eating, and other positive habits. He has also been a vocal advocate for various social causes, such as education and child welfare. By refusing to endorse tobacco products, Tendulkar demonstrated his commitment to these values and set an example for others to follow.\n So Sachin Tendulkar once again proved that he is a legend of the game and by not endorsing the tobacco products, he has earned more of our respect.\n"

    "question": "How does Iron Dome work, the system that protects Israel from rockets?",
    "answer": "What is the Iron Dome?\n It is a short-range, ground-to-air, air defence system that includes a radar and Tamir interceptor missiles that track and neutralise any rockets or missiles aimed at Israeli targets. It is used for countering rockets, artillery & mortars (C-RAM) as well as aircraft, helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles.\n The genesis of the Iron Dome goes back to the 2006 Israeli-Lebanon war, when the Hezbollah fired thousands of rockets into Israel. The following year, Israel announced that its state-run Rafael Advance Systems would come up with a new air defence system to protect its cities and people. It was developed with Israel Aerospace Industries.\n How does it work, and what makes it so effective?\n The Iron Dome has three main systems that work together to provide a shield over the area where it is deployed, handling multiple threats. It has a detection and tracking radar to spot any incoming threats, a battle management and weapon control system (BMC), and a missile firing unit. The BMC basically liaises between the radar and the interceptor missile.\n It is capable of being used in all weather conditions, including during the day and night.\n"

    "question": "Will the government shutdown be permanent?",
    "answer": "Question: Will the government shutdown be permanent?\n No, of course not.\n Within a relatively short period of time, it will become clear to both House and Senate Republicans that crafting a deal with the Democrats that will override Trump veto is more important than standing by the President is. They will do so to avoid the wrath of their constituents, especially when the shutdown starts to threaten payment for government benefits or slows down the processing of income tax returns.\n This may already be happening because fewer Republicans are openly backing Trump when claims that the wall/barrier is the only solution. If the GOP was afraid that their base would abandon them in the past, they are even more afraid that the “swing voters” who they need in many areas to win, decide to abandon them due to the shutdown. Without those voters, tough races will become out of reach for some candidates.\n The shutdown will end within the next few weeks (as of 10 January 2019) because it’s threatening to harm taxpayers, personally and the economy, overall. It will either be from the Congress overriding any veto from Trump; or it will be when Trump folds his hand, allows it to reopen and then pretends that he got what he wanted all along\n"

    "question": "What are some unique tips and tricks for improving productivity?",
    "answer": "Here are some unique tips and tricks that can help improve productivity:\n 1. Pomodoro Technique: This technique involves breaking your work into focused intervals of typically 25 minutes, known as \"pomodoros,\" followed by short breaks. After completing four pomodoros, take a longer break. This method helps maintain focus and avoid burnout.\n 2. Power Naps: Short power naps of around 15-20 minutes can provide a quick burst of rejuvenation and increase alertness. Find a quiet space, set an alarm, and allow yourself a brief rest to recharge and enhance productivity.\n 3. The Two-Minute Rule: If a task takes less than two minutes to complete, do it immediately. This rule prevents small tasks from piling up and saves time in the long run.\n 4. Habit Stacking: Pair a new habit you want to develop with an existing one. For example, if you want to incorporate reading into your routine, you could read for 15 minutes after brushing your teeth in the morning. Habit stacking leverages existing habits to make new habits easier to adopt.\n 5. The Eisenhower Matrix: Prioritize tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix, which categorizes tasks into four quadrants based on their urgency and importance: Do First (urgent and important), Schedule (important but not urgent), Delegate (urgent but not important), and Eliminate (neither urgent nor important). This method helps you focus on high-priority tasks.\n 6. Single-Tasking: Instead of multitasking, focus on one task at a time. Research shows that multitasking can decrease productivity and increase errors. By giving your full attention to a single task, you can complete it more efficiently and effectively.\n 7. Environment Optimization: Create a productive work environment by minimizing distractions and optimizing your workspace. Eliminate clutter, personalize your space, use noise-cancelling headphones, or explore ambient background noise apps to create an atmosphere conducive to concentration.\n 8. Digital Detox: Schedule regular breaks from digital devices and social media. Set specific time periods when you disconnect to reduce distractions, improve focus, and recharge your mental energy.\n 9. Mind Mapping: Use visual mind maps to organize and brainstorm ideas. Mind mapping allows you to visually connect concepts and generate creative solutions, enhancing productivity and clarity of thought.\n 10. Regular Physical Activity: Incorporate regular physical exercise into your routine. Exercise improves blood flow, enhances mood, reduces stress, and boosts cognitive function—all of which contribute to increased productivity.\n Remember, productivity techniques can vary in effectiveness depending on individual preferences and work styles. Experiment with different strategies to find what works best for you, and adapt them to suit your specific needs and circumstances.\n"

    "question": "Has Bipin Rawat cautioned Nepal about China’s footprint?",
    "answer": "Yes, India’s Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat has cautioned Nepal about China designs, while addressing the Second Annual Dialogue with Nepal Institute for International Cooperation and Engagement held on 17 December, 2020.\n General Rawat, while emphasizing on the closed historical ties between India and Nepal remarked that Nepal is free to follow her own independent policy in international affairs, but she should be vigilant and should learn from Sri Lanka and other countries which have signed agreement with other nations in the region.\n General Rawat indirectly referred to the China-Sri Lanka engagement under which China invested huge money in Sri Lanka in the form of loans. When Sri Lanka was not able to repay the loan in time, Sri Lanka signed agreement with China in 2017 to hand over her Hambantota port to China on 99 year lease, Thus China[s investment and BRI proved to be land grabbing tactics in neighbouring countries.\nImage Courtesy: 2020\n General Rawat wanted Nepal to remember this episode while signing similar deal with China. Nepal is due to sign a huge infrastructure deal for Chinese investment in road and rail connectivity projects in Nepal. If Nepal does not head to Genera Rawat’s advice, it may soon find herself trapped in the land grabbing debt trap of China.\n China has done similar deals in Maldives also. Even China’s all weather friend Pakistan is also going to be the next victim of China’s land grabbing economic diplomacy. Pakistan has already given Gwadar port to China on 40 year lease and China is increasing her footprints in Gilgit-Baltistan and other Islands of Pakistan. Afghanistan, Pakistan , Nepal and China have held foreign ministers level consultation to promote infrastructure development with Chinese investment.\n"

    "question": "What do I need to know about the University of Toronto?",
    "answer": "From personal experience the first year at UofT is probably one of the hardest because you're going through a huge transition. The short answer to this question is to get organized. Early.\nMeal Prep: Have a schedule for grocery shopping and cooking. There aren't a ton of options for food on campus. Most of them are overpriced for the portions you're receiving and you would be surprised how quickly costs add up.Give yourself enough time: The standard ratio for lecture vs. Study time is 1:3. For every hour of lecture, give yourself an average of 3 hours to read and do homework for that class.Make summaries of your notes & lecture notes per week. This will make your life easier when it's time to study for exams.Seek Out & Take Advantage of ALL opportunities and resources on campus. There are so many untapped resources at the University for employment, mentorship, financial aid, study skills, housing- both on and off campus, etc. Talk to your registrar and go to the Koffler House on College & St.George and inqure. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed there is someone to help you.Use the gyms at UofT. They're some of the best and most equipped gyms in the city. UofT has drop-in & paid classes if using gym equipment isn't your cup of tea. Exercise relieves stress, keeps you fit and should be worked into your schedule at least 3 times a week.UofT students get UNLIMITED Physiotherapy per school year. For only $80. It's located at the Goldring Centre. Located at Bloor & Devonshire.Do the utmost to stay on top of your work. This is self explanatory but work piles up quickly and falling behind is deadly.Develop a working relationship with an academic advisor, your registrar and your professors. Go to office hours as much as possible. Even if you don't have tons of questions. Developing a good relationship with Professors is invaluable. If you need extensions on assignments, reccomendations on classes for the following year, networking opportunities, ways to get involved with classes your interested in, etc., your professor is a great resource and person to talk to.If you commute, use that time to read or review for class.Book Study Rooms in advance. Good group rooms book up quickly. Make a point to scout out rooms a few weeks in advance and then book.\nThese are things that are less obvious. Most people don't know about or do these little things that make all the difference throughout the year. Good luck new first years!\n"

Here are some steps you can take to address the situation:\nTalk to your partner: Have an open and honest conversation with your partner about their feelings towards your dog. Try to understand their concerns and listen to their perspective without becoming defensive or dismissive.Discuss the importance of your dog: Explain why your therapy dog is important to you and how they contribute to your emotional well-being. Discuss any concerns your partner may have about the dog, such as allergies or behavioral issues, and see if there are ways to address them.Consider compromise: If possible, try to find a compromise that works for both you and your partner. For example, you could limit the amount of time your dog spends with your partner or designate certain areas of your home as pet-free zones.Seek professional help: If the situation continues to be a source of conflict and strain on your relationship, consider seeking the help of a professional therapist or counselor who can help you navigate the situation and find a solution.\nRemember, your therapy dog is an important part of your life and emotional well-being, and it is important to find a way to honor that while also respecting your partner's feelings and concerns.

    "answer": "It will not be a cake walk for either SP+BSP or BJP in the General Election 2019. As per 2014 General Election BJP+ secured 42.63% and SP+BSP+RLD got 42.98%. Congress do not count much as of now since it is not going to be a party to the opposition allaince. Probably Congress may align with Pragathipara Samajwadi Secular Morcha.\n Both the main groups of SP+BSP and BJP are vulnerable to even a small change in voting pattern. Since Shivpal Yadav has broken his relations with SP, it is certain to affect SP. Also because SP and BSP are having alliance both may at the most contest 50% of seats. Disgruntled elements in the party will either contest as rebels or join other parties or go against the official candidate or abstain. Hence the crucial 2% to 3% votes will be lost affecting the victory of their candidates. Probably because of these reasons these parties are keeping their seat distribution in tight wraps. They have not left any clue whatsoever on this.\n BJP too has many worries as Anupriya’s Apna Dal and Seheldev’s parties are playing game seeking more seats. If these two parties go independently or align with any other alliance, there is every possibility of BJP too losing 2% to 3% votes. Hence both the main groups are vulnerable and are fighting a tight election. Congress wherever they are do not impact the election in UP except in two constituencies of Amethy and Raebareli.\n"

Despite the pain, he continued to hobble down the track, determined to finish the race. As he limped towards the finish line, his father ran onto the track to help him cross the line. It was a powerful display of selflessness and love.\nBill Russell in the 1960 NBA Finals - During Game 7 of the NBA Finals, Russell's teammate, Frank Ramsey, fouled out with the game tied. Russell, who was already having an incredible game, volunteered to guard the opposing team's best player, Jerry West, for the remainder of the game. He held West to just two points in the final quarter and led his team to victory.\nJohan Cruyff in the 1974 World Cup - In a group-stage match against Sweden, Cruyff was awarded a penalty kick. Instead of taking the shot himself, he passed the ball to his teammate, who scored the goal. It was a selfless act that helped his team win the match and advance to the next round.\nPat Tillman - Tillman was an NFL player who gave up his career to enlist in the United States Army after the September 11 attacks. He served in the Army Rangers and was killed in action in Afghanistan in 2004. Tillman's decision to put his country ahead of his personal goals was a powerful display of selflessness.\nMuhammed Ali at the 1960 Olympics - When Ali (then known as Cassius Clay) won the gold medal in boxing, he was so proud of it that he refused to throw it in the Ohio River, which was a traditional act of defiance by African Americans against racism. Instead, he chose to keep the medal, and later, when a young fan told him that he wanted to be just like him, Ali took the medal off his neck and gave it to the boy.\n"

    "question": "Why was Michael Jordan not drafted #1 overall when he was clearly the best college player at the time? Who's to blame?",
    "answer": "Not one person ever blamed the Houston Rockets for drafting Hakeem Olajuwan #1. It was an era when if you had an elite center then you won titles. Only Julius Erving ever came close to dominating in the back court like MJ. That was only good for 1 title. Hakeem was a sure thing. That draft pick stood the test of time. When MJ retired, Hakeem took over for 2 years. Schooled HOFers Shaq and David Robinson in the playoffs. Greatest center ever IMO. They had their 2 guard. At the time an elite center took priority over an elite 2 guard. So, even in hindsight it was a wise pick. The Bulls just got incredibly lucky. The pick to be questioned in that draft was 7ft 2 in Sam Bowie at #2 by the Trail Blazers. Bowie had a history of knee injuries which caused him to miss 2 seasons in college. Amazingly, 25 years later history repeated itself when the Blazers selected 7ft Greg Oden with the first pick over 2X NBA Finals MVP and regular season MVP Kevin Durant. Oden also had a history of injuries but was 7 feet tall.\n"

    "answer": "Oddly enough, there IS a point to having highly-trained, professional infantry troops standing guard outside Buckingham Palace. Forget the tourist attraction of the scarlet tunics and Bearskin hats: These dudes are serious soldiers - the British Army’s Foot Guards.\n Foot Guards comprises 5 infantry Regiments: Grenadier, Coldstream, Scots, Irish and Welsh Guards. The Household Division also includes the Household Cavalry: Blues and Royals and Life Guards. We’ll leave them out for the time being, and concentrate on the Foot Guards.\n In case anyone thinks they’re there just for show, read this: They are armed with L85A3 assault rifles. Those weapons are “loaded” - in other words, they carry a full magazine of 30 x 5.56mm rounds. A Guardsman has only to activate the cocking-handle, and he’s ready to fire.\n On Public Duties (Buckingham Palace Guard) their rifles are fitted with bayonets. This is another traditional piece of military hardware which is instantly - and legally - deployable if a Guardsman judges that there is a threat to the Sovereign’s person. And it has been so deployed in fairly recent times.\n When not on Public Duties rotation, Guardsmen are standard British infantry soldiers. In recent times, they deployed regularly to Afghanistan, where they conducted routine infantry taskings and earned their keep as frontline soldiers. They alternate Light, Mechanised and Infantry roles as required.\n Identifying Guards Regiments is easy. Buttons on their scarlet tunics are grouped as follows: Single buttons - Grenadier Guards; Groups of two: Coldstream Guards; Groups of three: Scots Guards; Groups of four: Irish Guards; Groups of five: Welsh Guards.\n"

    "question": "Why did the Ottoman Empire successor state call itself Turkey, despite only encompassing a small part of the land where Turkish people live? Wouldn't something like Anatolia (or a Turkish language equivalent) have been more appropriate?",
    "answer": "First, you are mixing ‘Turkic’ with ‘Turkish’. Turkic people are a collection of many different ethnicities, including Azerbaijanis, Kazakhs, Uyghurs, Yakuts, Uzbeks, Turkmens and Turks (or the ‘Turkish people’). Turkish ethnonationalism is only concerned with the last one. Pan-Turkism was decently popular among the founders of the Turkish Republic but it never really amounted to much. Despite sharing similar languages and a common (ancient) past, Turkic people are an incredibly diverse group.\n Furthermore, Anatolia is a geographical region - one that is specifically used as a shorthand ‘rural Turkey’. It’s not a name that evokes nationalistic feelings. It also leaves out Thrace which, while small compared to Anatolia, is still a sizable and important part of the country.\n Note: Another answer to this question claims that Ottomans ‘never spoke Turkish’ and both Turkey and the Turkish republic are Western inventions. Both of these facts are factually incorrect and can be easily fact-checked.\n"

    "answer": "Night terrors occur about 2-3 hours after a child falls asleep when transitioning from REM (deep sleep) to no-REM (less deep sleep). They are caused by over-stimulation of the nervous system when the nervous system isn't fully developed. A night terror is similar to nightmares but far more dramatic. A child will not remember a night terror in the morning. A child having a night terror may…\n 1️⃣Shout out or scream in distress.2️⃣Suddenly, sit up in bed.3️⃣Have faster breathing and a quicker heartbeat.4️⃣SweatingThrashing around.5️⃣Acting upset and scared.\n After a few minutes, they will lay back down and fall back to sleep. Although night terrors are very distressing to the parents, it is best to wait patiently and if your child is thrashing around, make sure she doesn’t hurt herself.\n 👉Don’t try to wake your child up from a night terror, as she will fall back to sleep on his own. If night terrors happen frequently, talk to your child’s doctor about a possible referral to a sleep specialist.\n 🧠Connect the Neurons:Night terrors are a normal part of development. Most children experience them between ages 4-12. They disappear on their own when the nervous system matures.\n[LINKED_TEXT: Instagramhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CkxzWL9MqyO/] [URL: https://www.instagram.com/p/CkxzWL9MqyO/]"

    "question": "Is NASA making the wheels on the Mars 2020 rover significantly stronger since there has been constant anxiety over damage to the wheels on the Curiosity rover?",
    "answer": "Over the last two decades, Martian rovers have outlived their mission lives by many years. While the rovers are designed for a few months of service to complete their primary mission objectives, they often continue functioning for years afterward (beyond their warranties, if you will).\n Understandably, years of service across rough terrain takes its toll on wheels that were only designed to reliably survive for a few months on the Martian surface. The Mars 2020 rover is also a larger, heavier robotic laboratory than any previous rovers, so an upgrade was anticipated.\n According to NASA:\n“Engineers redesigned the Mars 2020 wheels to be more robust due to the wear and tear the Curiosity rover wheels endured while driving over sharp, pointy rocks. Mars 2020's wheels are narrower than Curiosity's, but bigger in diameter and made of thicker aluminum.\n The combination of the larger instrument suite, new Sampling and Caching System, and modified wheels makes Mars 2020 heavier than its predecessor, Curiosity.”\n"

    "question": "Why do iMessages go through as text messages and calls go straight to voicemail?",
    "answer": "A green background means that the message you sent or received was delivered by SMS through your cellular provider. It also typically went to a non-iOS device such as an Android or Windows phone.\n Sometimes you can also send or receive green text messages to an iOS device. This happens when iMessage is turned off on one of the devices.\n You can check if iMessage is on or off your iPhone by going to your iPhone Settings (gear icon) and then to Messages. Enable iMessage.\n When your text message has a blue background, it means that your message exchange happened via iMessage and that you sent or received your message to and from another iOS device.\n When your iPhone is locked (the screen is off), Do Not Disturb silences all incoming calls, text message notifications, and alerts on your iPhone. Unlike silent mode, Do Not Disturb sends incoming calls straight to voicemail.\n Look in the upper right-hand corner of your iPhone, just to the left of the battery icon. If you see a crescent moon, Do Not Disturb is turned on.\n The fastest way to turn off Do Not Disturb is found in Control Center. To open Control Center, use your finger to swipe up from the bottom of your iPhone’s display. Look for the crescent moon icon, and tap it with your finger to turn off Do Not Disturb.\n"

    "question": "What happens when you get pulled over doing 100 mph?",
    "answer": "In the Canadian province of Ontario, if you are caught driving more than 50 km/h (31 mph) over the posted speed limit (which is 100 km/h or 60 mph on most highways):\nThe car is automatically impounded for 7 days (regardless of who owns the car), resulting in towing/impound fees (~$1000).The driver automatically has their license suspended for 7 days (~$280 for reinstatement)The driver receives a court summons to answer to the charges of “speeding over 50+” ($600+ fine) and the automatic charge of “stunt driving”, which carries a minimum fine of $2000.If the driver is found guilty of these charges (many will reach plea agreements with prosecutors for lesser charges), they are often uninsurable with regular insurance companies and will need to get high-risk “facility insurance” if they want to continue driving ($8000-$10000/year for 3 years).There are also demerit points and other administrative fines, but these are minor compared to the other consequences.\nIn summary, it’s $1500 immediately + $2000+ in fines + $10,000+ in insurance premiums, though many first time offenders are able to plea guilty to lesser charges and significantly the fines and premiums (often “49 over” the limit) which is ~$400 fine and considered a speeding ticket for insurance purposes.\n"

    "answer": "A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind and blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering.\n It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis.\n The axis of the shell may be either horizontal or at a small angle to the horizontal. It is partially filled with balls.\n A chocolate holding tank, also called a chocolate tempering tank or chocolate melting tank, is a piece of equipment used in the chocolate manufacturing process.\n It is used to melt and hold chocolate at a specific temperature, usually around 45-50 degrees Celsius (113-122 degrees Fahrenheit), in order to make it easier to work with and to ensure a smooth texture in the finished product.\n The tank is typically made of stainless steel and is designed to keep the chocolate at a consistent temperature using heating elements or a tempering process. Some chocolate holding tanks also have agitators to mix and emulsify the chocolate while it is melting.\n"

    "question": "Why do some generators run on natural gas? Isn't there a chance that in a hurricane or weather event that causes a power outage that the natural gas will be shut off as well? Wouldn't this defeat the purpose of it in these events?",
    "answer": "The natural gas supply is very reliable. Other than in places with earthquakes, or in a situation where a very large gas explosion affects supplies, it tends to keep supplying end users.\n The main reason is that even if the gas utility does not add gas into the supply system, the pressure in major gas supply lines is high enough that the supply line itself contains a significant quantity of gas and can maintain enough pressure to supply end users for a long time - several days. There are several reasons why gas distribution pressure is much higher than end-user supply pressure (for most end users) and this reliability is one of them. Another reason is to stop the retail end users messing with the gas supply to defraud the supplier.\n Additionally, transport and compression facilities in gas networks are typically powered from the gas itself (most gas compressors are powered by gas turbines derived from aviation technology, which burn some gas to compress the rest) and their control equipment is built to run independently of the electrical grid if required. Because electricity is generated from gas, it is important that gas networks do not need the electricity grid to operate or the electricity grid could never self-start.\n Gas supplies are always underground, which protects them from most natural forces (except earthquakes and extreme erosive events). You have to protect the lines delivering to your equipment, but that is within your control. You can build a reinforced blockhouse around your supply entry point, or otherwise protect the gas lines as they run around your site.\n Therefore, operating an electrical generator from the gas supply is a reasonable decision in most circumstances. If you have a strong need for redundancy, on-site compressed gas tanks with automatic supply switching could be used.\n One of the most frequent problems with diesel-powered site electricity generators in longer power outages is refuelling them. Getting fuel deliveries when transport infrastructure is disrupted and many consumers want to get fuel can be difficult. A contractor may not be able to get to the site, or may just not fulfil the contract. There is little you can do in that sort of scenario. Gas pipelines usually keep delivering gas.\n"

    "question": "What is the difference between a delay pedal and a reverb pedal?",
    "answer": "Delay is one or more echoes, usually far apart in time enough to discern one or more echoes\n An electronic units this is usually accomplished by taking a sample of the input audio and holding it in memory and then releasing it, and the processing has to be strong enough to handle the resampling in the buffering without any problems. Sometimes if you mess with the knobs you can hear problems as the algorithm has to readjust\n In the past, delay was accomplished by using tape, delayed playback but today it is too expensive even though that does not matter to everyone. Look up the Roland space Echo\n Reverb is like delay but millions of echoes close enough in time to sound like a blur. And digital units it's only thousands or even dozens of echoes but that's fine\n In most guitar amps reverb is accomplished by feeding the sound into springs that sympathetically resonate and create millions of Reflections in a tiny metal box. Pretty cool\n Both can occur in nature, but at the same time. In some situations you can notice delay and in some situations you can notice reverb, depends on the space but in the physics sence both are always happening unless if you are in an anechoic chamber\n The psychoacoustic line in the middle between Reverb and Delay has to do with the HAAS effect. Look that up\n"

Natural stone is often irregular in shape and has a natural, organic look. Glass, on the other hand, is usually smooth and has a uniform, manufactured look.Weight: Natural stone is typically heavier than glass. This is because natural stone is made up of minerals, which are heavier than the materials used to make glass.Sound: When tapped, natural stone will produce a dull sound. Glass, on the other hand, will produce a clear, ringing sound.Rubbing test: Rub the stone against your teeth. Natural stone will feel gritty, while glass will feel smooth.Magnet test: Natural stone is not magnetic, while glass is.\nIf you are still unsure whether a material is natural stone or glass, you can take it to a jeweler or other professional who can help you identify it.\n Here are some additional tips for identifying natural stone and glass:\nColor: Natural stone comes in a wide variety of colors, while glass is typically clear or colored.Transparency: Natural stone is often translucent, while glass is typically transparent.Hardness: Natural stone is typically harder than glass. This means that it is more difficult to scratch or damage.Cleavage: Natural stone often has a distinct cleavage pattern, which is a way that the stone breaks along natural planes. Glass does not have a cleavage pattern.\nBy using these methods, you can usually identify natural stone and glass with a high degree of accuracy.\n"

    "question": "Is this correct? Thermal conductivity says how much thermal energy will permeate a material in a unit amount of time, whereas thermal diffusivity says how much area a unit of energy will permeate in a unit amount of time. If not, what am I missing?",
    "answer": "No, you’re wrong. The other answer gives you the theory, which is complex. If you seek for intuitive things, these are:\nThermal conductivity is the ratio of heat flux to temperature difference. Thus, it tells you how close a material is to be isothermal in a given situation. If it is low, the material is an insulator and thus has internally an elevated temperature difference. Good conductors have high conductivity and in accordance their temperature differences are small.Thermal diffusivity tells you how quickly temperature changes during a transient, because it is the ratio of conductivity to heat storage capacity. The higher the diffusivity (either because of a high conductivity or a low ability to store heat), the quicker the change; you can see this directly in the differential Eq. written in the other answer. A good example is the comparison of steel and aluminum cookware; the second is much more conductive and has a low density and heat capacity, its diffusivity being much higher. Thus, the cookware heats up much sooner, you can experience this directly in your kitchen.\n"

    "question": "How does the titration curve of a weak acid/strong base titration differ from a strong acid/strong base titration?",
    "answer": "Titration Curve for Weak Acid/Strong Base Titration and Strong Acid/Strong Base Titration\n A titration curve is a graph that shows the pH of a solution as a function of the volume of titrant added during a titration. In a titration, a known volume of a solution of known concentration (the titrant) is slowly added to a solution of unknown concentration (the analyte) until the reaction between the two is complete. The titration curve for a weak acid/strong base titration differs from that of a strong acid/strong base titration due to differences in the acidity of the starting solution and the endpoint of the titration.\n Weak Acid/Strong Base Titration\n In a weak acid/strong base titration, the starting solution is acidic because the weak acid is only partially dissociated, producing a low concentration of H+ ions. As the strong base is added, it reacts with the weak acid to form the conjugate base of the acid and water. This increases the pH of the solution until the equivalence point is reached. At the equivalence point, all of the weak acid has been neutralized, and the solution contains only the conjugate base of the acid and water. The pH at the equivalence point is greater than 7, indicating that the solution is basic. The titration curve for a weak acid/strong base titration is characterized by a gradual increase in pH until it reaches a sharp increase in pH at the equivalence point, after which the pH levels off.\n Strong Acid/Strong Base Titration\n In a strong acid/strong base titration, the starting solution is acidic because the strong acid is completely dissociated, producing a high concentration of H+ ions. As the strong base is added, it reacts with the H+ ions to form water, increasing the pH of the solution. The pH increases rapidly at the beginning of the titration due to the high concentration of H+ ions, and then levels off as the equivalence point is reached. At the equivalence point, all of the H+ ions have been neutralized, and the solution contains only the conjugate base of the acid and water. The pH at the equivalence point is 7, indicating that the solution is neutral. The titration curve for a strong acid/strong base titration is characterized by a rapid increase in pH until it reaches a plateau at the equivalence point, after which the pH levels off.\n"

    "question": "Can Monero transactions be traced?",
    "answer": "The primary benefits of cryptocurrencies as a trading medium are decentralization and the promise of anonymity. Users want to avoid the prying eyes of governments, hackers, megacorporations, and anyone else who might profit from compiling a dossier on their financial activity. So, can Monero be tracked?\n What Is the Meaning of Monero?\n Monero (XMR) is an open-source cryptocurrency built on a proof-of-work (PoW) network with an emphasis on anonymity. The Monero blockchain employs a number of strategies to conceal transaction data and increase anonymity.\n Monero, a Bytecoin derivative, first appeared in 2014 as Bitmonero. It was posted by the alias thankfulfortoday on the Bitcointalk forum. The new coin was most likely created using CryptoNote, a system described in a white paper published in October 2013 by Nicolas van Saberhagen. The author emphasized the importance of privacy and anonymity in electronic money, calling Bitcoin's traceability a \"major flaw.\" So, can Monero be tracked?\n Because of disagreements about the new coin's future direction, community members forked it to form Monero.\n After Ethereum and Bitcoin, Monero has the third-largest development community. One of the two publicly acknowledged developers is Riccardo Spagni, a South African developer currently working on the project. Many members of the core development team have chosen to remain anonymous.\n Throughout the years, the team has added more privacy safeguards to encourage advanced levels of digital anonymity for transaction data and user identification.\n The concept, as well as its native XMR token, has gained popularity among crypto enthusiasts and privacy advocates. In terms of market value, Monero is now the most valuable privacy-focused cryptocurrency.\n[LINKED_TEXT: Is Monero traceable?Governmental players, hackers, megacorporations, and anyone who could profit from compiling their financial activity.

    "question": "Who is the most inspiring superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe?",
    "answer": "That will forever be Captain America.\nUnlike most of the Marvel superheroes, Cap didn’t find his powers in a freak accident, or create them with his genius, or stumble upon them through a magical object. Instead, he was given these powers as a mark of his merit. He was chosen to receive these powers for the spirit, determination, and courage he showed well before he had any kind of power.\nBecause at one point, Cap was just a weakling. He was unusually small, thin, and had dealt with numerous health conditions his entire life. And yet, he chose to use what little strength he had to stand up to bullies. That kind of character is rare. It’s hard enough to find those willing to stand up to bullies when they have the power to do so, but for someone far weaker than normal? Even rarer.\n But that’s the kind of man Steve Rogers has always been. That’s the kind of man the super-soldier serum only enhanced, increasing everything from his strength to his courage, building upon the hero he had always been rather than creating one that wasn’t there.\nAnd it’s a good thing it did, because even with his newfound powers, Captain America constantly faced threats and villains well past his power level. Loki was too much for him:\nUltron was too much for him:\nIron Man was too much for him, alone:\nThanos was too much for him the first time:\nAnd the second time:\nYet somehow, every time, Cap picked himself up, dusted himself off, and came back for more. Because no matter how outmatched he was, he always gave his all. He was a man against gods, facing warriors with 10x his ability and strength, but he never backed down.\n Cap’s greatest moment of triumph came in Endgame. He had been beaten to a bloody pulp by Thanos, his shield had been torn to pieces, and his friends had been tossed about. But what did he do? He staggered to his feet, fought the pain with gritted teeth, and stood in the face of Thanos and his entire army. He had no chance of victory, no hope of winning...\n"

    "question": "What is the best way to describe the position of the Flemish Movement in Belgium? Could Flanders ever become independent or join the Netherlands in the future?",
    "answer": "Most people don't know the history of that area, back in the 1500s Belgium and Netherlands were combined and ruled by the Hapsburgs called The Spanish Netherlands. During and after the 30 Years War 1618–1648 France began a campaign to Attack the southern part of it, and they also began an Independence movement where Amsterdam would flood its own city to rid themselves of Spanish troops, they would release the water from the sleuces or dikes. As Independence came closer France kept attacking the Belgium part due to their French speaking, Catholic ways, while Netherlands were more German and Protestant, so a split seemed logical. Napoleon was the last Tyrant that tried to keep them together, but by the Revolutions of 1820 and 1830 Belgium was freed under their own king and Netherlands ruled by the House of Orange, but was more like a Republic. However, Belgium was condemned by the world after their genocide in the Congo in the 1800s, so their movement again would have to wait. After WW1 Belgium lost its kingdom and the borders redone again, but the minority of German speaking Protestant peoples of Flanders in Belgium were ruled by the French leaning Catholics. Since Benelux started the European Union after WW2, they again had more freedom and now began to be able to move as they wished within the EU nations, which appeased them for the time being, but what about the ones who just want to stay and cry foul of arbitrary border drawing? Today, we now have the free East Belgium movement, similar too the Basque in Spain, but much less violent. But The EU has real political issues now that England is gone and many countries are on the verge of bankruptcy like Portugal, Greece and Italy. Who bails them all out? Germany. So the German speaking or Flemish speaking Belgians are emboldened to get the change that they want. Just like the Netflix show Brewmasters shows us the beer making Monks of Flanders are always fighting the protestants of the Dutch speakers.\n"

    "question": "Why aren't Macs being built with touch screens?",
    "answer": "There are a few reasons why most Macs are not built with touchscreens:\nMacOS is not optimized for touch input: MacOS, the operating system that runs on Macs, was not designed with touch input in mind. As a result, using a touchscreen on a Mac might not be as seamless or intuitive as using one on a device that was designed specifically for touch, like a smartphone or a tablet.Touchscreen Macs might not be as practical: Most people use their Macs for tasks that are not well suited for touch input, such as typing, programming, or photo editing. While touchscreens can be convenient for certain tasks, they might not be as practical for the types of work that many people do on their Macs.Touchscreen Macs could be more expensive: Adding a touchscreen to a Mac would likely increase its cost. As a result, touchscreen Macs might be less affordable for some users.\nOverall, while touchscreens can be a useful feature on some devices, there are currently practical and technical limitations to adding them to Macs.\n"

    "question": "Is it better to take a home loan or to cut some amount from salary every month to make a home?",
    "answer": "Deciding whether to take a home loan or save from your salary to buy a home is a personal financial decision that depends on various factors. Here are some key considerations to help you make an informed choice:\nAffordability: Evaluate your current financial situation and determine how much you can comfortably save from your salary each month. Consider your monthly expenses, existing financial obligations, and the amount you can allocate towards saving for a home.Timeframe: Consider the timeframe within which you want to purchase a home. Saving from your salary may take a longer time compared to taking a home loan, which allows you to buy a home sooner and pay for it over a period of time.Interest Rates: Compare the interest rates offered on home loans with the potential returns you could earn on your savings. If the home loan interest rates are low, it may be more advantageous to take a loan and invest your savings elsewhere to potentially earn higher returns.Financial Goals: Assess your broader financial goals and priorities. If you have other financial goals such as retirement planning or investment opportunities that require your savings, it might be more beneficial to take a home loan and allocate your savings towards those goals.Tax Benefits: Explore the tax benefits associated with home loans. In many countries, you may be eligible for tax deductions on the interest paid on home loans. Consider how these tax benefits can impact your overall financial situation.Risk Tolerance: Evaluate your risk tolerance. Taking a home loan involves debt obligations and interest payments, while saving from your salary might provide a more risk-averse approach. Assess your comfort level with debt and the impact it may have on your financial stability.Considering these factors, you can decide whether to opt for a home loan or to cut some amount from salary every month.\n"

    "question": "What are some reasons why people might avoid using test-driven development (TDD), especially if they are following the advice of someone like Kent Beck?",
    "answer": "There are several reasons why people might avoid using test-driven development (TDD), even if they are following the advice of someone like Kent Beck, who is known for promoting TDD. Some of these reasons include:\nLack of experience or understanding: TDD can be challenging for those who are not familiar with the methodology or who have not used it extensively. Some developers may find it easier to stick to traditional development practices that they are more familiar with.Time constraints: TDD can be a time-consuming process, especially in the beginning stages of development. Some developers may feel that they don't have the time to devote to writing tests before writing the actual code.Over-reliance on testing: Some developers may feel that TDD places too much emphasis on testing, and that this can detract from other important aspects of development, such as design and architecture.Not applicable to all projects: TDD may not be the best approach for all types of projects, such as those that involve complex algorithms or where the requirements are constantly changing.Lack of immediate benefits: The benefits of TDD may not be immediately apparent, and some developers may not see the value in investing time and effort into writing tests before writing code.\nOverall, while TDD can be a highly effective development methodology, it may not be the best fit for every project or every developer. It's important to consider individual strengths and preferences when deciding whether or not to use TDD in a particular context.\n"

    "question": "Did Robert E. Lee ever return to Gettysburg or Appomattox?",
    "answer": "There was never any reason why he would have, and there is no record of him ever returning to either place. He may have traversed some of the battlefields in the Wilderness/Spotsylvania area and Manassas when he visited Washington after the war, and he is known to have been in Richmond after the war, but that’s about it.\n He easily could have visited Appomattox from where he lived at Washington College (now Washington & Lee University) after the war; they are only about 60 miles apart. But he had no reason to ever do so.\n And Gettysburg probably pained him for the rest of his life. He knew he had made grave errors there. Pickett never forgave him, but Lee likely never forgave himself, either.\n Lee died in 1870, long before any commemorations of the Civil War occurred. Furthermore, he was opposed to such things and believed the South should put the war behind it and focus on rebuilding itself. This was one of the reasons why Lee accepted the leadership of Washington College after the war—he wanted to help the next generation.\n Even if Lee had lived to be a very old man (he was 63 when he died), it is unlikely he’d have ever wanted to return to those places.\n"

    "question": "Why Sikhs didn’t participate in 3rd battle of Panipat?",
    "answer": "Marathas who had a powerful army , after the fall of Mughals never reached Punjab to help the Sikhs who were fighting as unorganised small groups against the mighty Afghans. These scattered small groups of sikhs were called Misales. Sikhs and their families were alwsys under the attack of Governer of Punjab ,who by orders of Abdaali was bent upon to annihilate the Sikhs from the land.Afghan Governer of Punjab did a dreaded army operation against sikhs which is known in history as small hollocaust . He boastly reported to Abdaali that Sikhs are finished and not even a child having hair is spared. This holocaust proved merely a nightmare for the Afghans. Scattered sikhs reunited themselves and showed their might against victorious Ahmed Shah Abdali when he was passing through Punjab while returning from western India January 1761 after Battle of Panipat .In Panipat he defeated powerful Maratha army and captured thousands of man women as war prisoners. Abdaali was attacked, trapped and plundered by united Sikhs force in April 1761 under one sikh commander . Sikh army plundered back the Afghan army from the wealth and booty which Afghans had plundered from western India.Sikhs also get liberated those thousands of captive men and women of war prisoners . Afgan chief was badly rabied from the unexpected surprise attack by Sikhs . He was unable to show his retaliation and might to these small band of sikhs because he and his army was badly tired of long battles and he had to return back to his country. Next time Abdaali himself led a furious attack on reunited Sikhs in Feb 1762 .Inspiration of their unification was Sarbat Khalsa at Amritsar .Petty disputes of Sikh leaders were settled at Darbar Khalsa and the leader of these reunited sikh was elected unanimously. Abdaali with the help of governer Sirhind and Lahore,he chased Sikhs and their families in every nuke and corner. About 20 thousands Sikhs along with their families were killed in this hollocaust called big hollocaust.But this holocaust also could not defeat Sikhs,but proved a night mare for Abdali . Destruction of Golden Temple by Abdaali to humiliate Sikh morals ,reunited scattered Sikhs with more enthusiasm and energy to revenge. This act of Abdali to destroy Golden Temple was end of mighty king of Kabul. This time Abdali was defeated by Sikhs ,about 5 thousands of Afgan soldiers surrendered . Sikhs used these captive Afghan army to cleane the sacred pound around golden temple and to rebuild Golden Temple. Defeated Abdaali returned to Kabul and never look back to words India. United Sikh chiefs made confederation of (confederacies ) called Misals.From 1762 to 1799 Sikh chiefs were independent warlords of their confederacies. Sikh kingdom was established in1799. Third battle of Panipat was fought between Abdali and Marathas in1761.\n"

    "question": "Why do people say that Steph Curry is 5′11″ and 6′3″?",
    "answer": "People may say that Steph Curry is both 5'11\" and 6'3\" due to a combination of his listed height and his perceived height on the court.\n Officially, Curry is listed as 6'3\" by the NBA, which is his height without shoes. However, some people might perceive him as shorter than that due to his lean frame and playing style. Additionally, some players in the NBA may exaggerate their height, leading to discrepancies between official listings and actual heights.\n On the other hand, some people might perceive Curry as shorter than 6'3\" due to the way he plays on the court. Curry is known for his quickness, agility, and ability to create space from defenders, which might make him seem smaller than he actually is. Additionally, Curry is often compared to other NBA players who are taller and more physically imposing, which might further emphasize his perceived lack of height.\n Overall, it is important to remember that height can be subjective and influenced by various factors. While Curry is officially listed as 6'3\", his actual height might appear differently to different people depending on their perspective and context.\n"

    "question": "What should I use to build the backend of my React Native application?",
    "answer": "To build the backend for your React Native application, you have several options to choose from depending on your requirements, familiarity, and preferences. Here are some popular choices:\nNode.js with Express.js: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side, making it a popular choice for building backend applications. Express.js is a lightweight web framework for Node.js that simplifies routing, middleware management, and request handling.Django: Django is a high-level Python web framework that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It provides a robust set of tools and features for building scalable and secure web applications.Ruby on Rails: Ruby on Rails, often referred to as Rails, is a web application framework written in Ruby. It follows the convention-over-configuration principle and emphasizes simplicity and developer productivity.Firebase: Firebase is a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform provided by Google. It offers a wide range of services, including a real-time database, authentication, cloud functions, hosting, and more. Firebase simplifies backend development by handling server infrastructure and providing easy-to-use APIs.GraphQL: GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that allow clients to request specific data they need. It provides a flexible and efficient way to define and query APIs, and it can be used with various backend technologies such as Node.js, Django, or Ruby on Rails.Serverless Framework: Serverless Framework is a popular framework for building applications using serverless architectures. It allows you to write backend logic as functions and deploy them to various cloud providers like AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions.\nThese are just a few options, and there are many other backend technologies available.

    "question": "Some wine bottles have a punt, and some don’t. But do the bottles hold the same amount of wine?",
    "answer": "Yes. Wine (and spirits for that matter) are highly regulated and only vary from the typical (750ml, 1L, 1.5L) volumes by micro milliliters thanks to computer automated filling machines. If you look at a bottle with punt and without you’ll notice very small differences in size of the bottle, fill line, thickness of the glass, etc; this is to offset the slight interior volume differences that a punt might create.\n “Historically, punts were a function of wine bottles being made by glassblowers. The seam was pushed up to make sure the bottle could stand upright and there wasn't a sharp point of glass on the bottom. It's also thought that the punt added to the bottle's structural integrity.” -Dr. Vinny, Wine Spectator\n Historically as well when glass was blown instead of pressed into a machine the punt allowed the wine maker to actually create a more consistent interior volume as they could push the punt further into or less far into the depths of the bottle while keeping a consistent exterior look and shape to the bottles. So with today much more automated glass making process a punt is more decorative than necessary.\n"

    "question": "Does any species exist which can’t thrive in captivity?",
    "answer": "Deep ocean animals adapted to high pressures will never thrive in captivity. This blobfish looks like a blob only on the surface because it’s depressurized. In its natural habitat, it looks nothing like this at all.\n There are many species that will not thrive in captivity.\nSome animals, like many species of whales or giant squids, are enormous and on top of that they are aquatic and we are not. We would need to provide them with a marine habitat multiple times their size that would require megastructure scale construction and maintenance. Because of that, there are still many unknowns about the behaviour and biology of such huge animals.There is a huge diversity of life in deep oceans that is adapted to very high pressures. Recreating this sort of habitat for them is an enormous challenge.All aspects of the physiology and behaviour of some flying animals, like swallows, are so streamlined for flying that they would never thrive in captivity.Many animals have some very specific and unusual requirements that are very difficult or challenging to recreate. It could be a diet or something very quirky.There aren’t that many extremophile animals, like some that live in hydrothermal vents but there are many extremophile microorganisms that scientists would like to research in the lab. They cannot do it, however, because it’s too difficult to recreate their habitat that might be unlike anything that we are used to. It can be high PH, temperature, pressure, salinity and others. Often many of these all at once.What is thrive? There are many animals that humans keep in captivity and provide them with a habitat similar to what they are used to in nature but it doesn’t mean that they thrive. Famously, it’s often celebrated, when babies of many captive animals are born. Even the ones that seemingly cope with captivity might have their lifespan reduced. Although, there are also some examples of animals that live longer in zoos than in nature, where they can succumb early in life to predators.\nMany animals in captivity exhibit abnormal behaviours like repeating some ticks, they can self-harm, self-bite, hair or feather pluck, excessively self-groom. Some primates can even poke their eyes out with their own fists. All of this means that animals that thrive in captivity are actually rather rare in comparison to animals that don’t, at least in some aspects. Sometimes it would aid conservation efforts if some endangered species were easier to keep in zoos.\n The question was: Does any species exist which can’t thrive in captivity?\n"

    "question": "Are Hong Kong activists still protesting in 2021?",
    "answer": "The major political leaders of the opposition are all but arrested or fled. Their supporters are without a leader and can’t really form any sort of real action. The remaining opposition (not of the same ideals of the arrested people) are either bogus/too tame or do not think protesting is worth it under the new extremely restrictive status quo. Corona is a convenient reason to deny even the tamest protest not just here, but around the world. Yes, you have to apply for a license to physically protest. Old and easily abused colonial laws. New laws imposed by the Central and local governments make it uncertain if most of the protested issues are still legal to protest for, given that the HK gov stretches its applicable areas very far.\n IMO HK government just doesn’t know to do things in moderation or to leave some room for expression. They are going about maintaining peace as ordered by the central government, but they are acting sort of triumph over the opposition which is kind of unsavoury. Like they could have maintained peace without always mentioning the opposition you quelled all the time.\n"

    "question": "People of the world: seeing what is happening in Ukraine, do you now understand Palestinians more?",
    "answer": "No, the analogy between Ukraine and Palestine doesn’t work at all.\n The better analogy is clearly between Ukraine and Israel. Both Ukrainians and Israeli have lost the sovereignty for many centuries - they were citizens in countries ruled by other nations (the Russian Empire; the Arab civilization or the Roman and British Empire) and they simply didn’t have any territory of their own.\n So recently, in 1948 in the case of Israel, 1991 in the case of Ukraine, they finally declared independence and sovereignty over some territory that used to belong to their ancestors a millennium or two or three ago (Judea from the Bible etc. and Kievan Rus), and they are still being terrorized and their very right to have a country (or to exist and stay alive?) is being challenged by the large sea-like nation that surrounds them - which is Arabs or Muslims (including the Iranians!) in the Israeli case, and Russians in the Ukrainians’ case.\n Palestinians as a separate nation are really a deception. They are just Arabs who want to take some territory (which has belonged to the Jews since 1948) even though Arabs already (and still) have a huge territory around, including gigatons of fossil fuels (sorry but the land that is controlled by Arabs is a vastly greater percentage of the landmass than the percentage of Arab contributions to mankind).\n The word for Palestine has been around for over 2,000 years (Palashtu, Pilistu)… but only much more recently, it became a territory with an Arab quasi-majority. Those 2,000 years ago, the dominant inhabitants had a very different ethnic origin. Jews were moving there before Israel was established and soon afterwards, they became a majority in Israel (and even extended Israel) instead. But the non-Jewish people who compete with Jews are not really members of some very old nation that has an equally characteristic tie with the territory. They are simply a subset of Arabs whose ancestors came there much more recently, but they finally lost this small piece of the Arab land around 1948.\n The claims that the Arabs have the right to control the territory of Israel are pretty much the same fascist demagogy as the Russians’ claimed right to own Ukraine.\n"

    "question": "If the superfluid can flow through the bottom of a container and climb its walls to escape it and then keep flowing on the outer side, does it also flow through the walls in left and right directions, not just up and down?",
    "answer": "The only superfluids that we know of (so far) are the two isotopes of helium. ‘Standard’ He-4 shows it’s superfluid component at a temperature of a few kelvin. The ‘rare’ isotope He-3 doesn’t become superfluid until it is a thousand times colder, a few milli-kelvin.\n Superfluids do flow with zero viscosity through extremely fine, packed powders, but NOT through glass containers. It ‘escapes’ the glass (as you note) by ‘climbing’ the sides and syphoning down the outer surface. The inner surface becomes wetted by the van Der Waals forces between the liquid and the glass. ‘Every’ liquid can wet the inner surface of a gas container - but only a superfluid can flow without viscosity in this film and syphon itself out of the container.\n Kitchen Experiment - Fill a glass with water and drape a cotton cloth from inside the glass down into the sink. With enough time the glass will become empty. Set the glass on the edge of the sink and you can watch the water drip from the cloth. Water is using ‘capillary attraction’ to wet the cloth and form the syphon. Superfluid helium uses the quantum mechanical van Der Waals force to do the same thing.\n Keep Questioning.\n"

    "question": "When will USA and its European allies realize Putin isn’t bluffing when he says we are getting closer to nuclear war?",
    "answer": "The thought of using nuclear weapons doesn’t really originate from Putin. He knows this would not turn out well for Russia in general or him in particular.\n Rather, this thought and threat is encouraged by the one party who would benefit immensely if Russia lobbed a nuke: China.\n In this scenario, if Vlad were to order a single “tactical” nuclear weapon, the response would be devastating. To Russia. Every one of their subs and combatant surface ships would be sunk, within minutes to hours. All Russian Command and Control assets would be obliterated. All potential locations of Russian nuclear weapons would be destroyed almost instantly. Then would come the ground troops of NATO, who would render Moscow into a blot.\n During all of this, China would be the most vocal advocate of all these actions, while participating in none of them. They will be quite content to allow the West to rid the world of everything Russia might have which could threaten China.\n Then, when the dust settles, it will be China who will advance and absorb Siberia. Moscow (what is left of it) will become the latter-day Berlin, split down the middle. Poland would claim St Petersburg, Ukraine would absorb one oblast east and north of the 2014 borders.\n China is encouraging this. They are engineering the West to do the heavy lifting for them.\n"

    "question": "After the defeat at the Battle of Midway, why didn't the IJN remove Nagumo from command?",
    "answer": "Anyone examining Nagumo’s performance at Midway would find very little to fault based on his reactions to intelligence as it came in. The kinds of decisions he was making during the battle were of the perfectly normal sort that pretty much anyone in his position would make. The correct choice is only obvious in hindsight.\n In truth, he was supposed to take out the Island defenses in one bomber strike, which was an impossible task. Yamamoto should have assigned at least a battleship and a couple of cruisers to assist. It should not have been done strictly from the air.\n This in turn, forced Nagumo to order a second strike. Up to this point, every attempt to attack his ships had failed miserably. He had no reason to worry. It’s this pivotal moment where everything came apart. His one mistake was not foreseeing that his forces were about to be walloped by experienced pilots flying much better planes.\n Much of his defeat can be traced to bad luck. His zeroes were chasing down the last of a doomed American squadron and completely out of position when the main attack came. In the span of a few minutes, three aircraft carriers were lost.\n This was partly because they were in the middle of switching up who was going to fly and had hose, bombs and fuel exposed, but Japanese carriers had bad fire control and it while it made things worse, those ships couldn’t take that kind of damage and survive.\n Nagumo didn’t decide not to include battleships, nor did he decide how to build the carriers. He was not indecisive either, he just made the wrong decision.\n"

Then you will understand his point.Richard Grant White was a controversialist. He regularly challenged the norms of language.His point is that English does not have the same formality of grammar that a language like Latin ( and those languages that are derived from it- the Romance languages ) does.If you match things like correspondences between verb cases, genders, possessives, pronouns; it uses different rules to Romance languages; and some English grammatical constructions seen nonsensical of you measure them against Latin.His point, proposed in Chapter 9 and developed in chapter 10, is intended to criticise those who try to force the English language into the structure of a Latin language, and criticised the forced alignment of English with latin.

    "question": "Who's Gef, the talking mongoose?",
    "answer": "The story of Gef is now quite forgotten, but it remains bizarre.\n Gef, ‘the talking mongoose’, was supposed to be a ghost that haunted a farm called Doarlish Cashen, in the Isle of Man, in the 1930s.\n In 1931, a schoolgirl called Voirrey Irving claimed she regularly received visits from a little furry animal that looked like a weasel and caused knocking sounds to emanate from behind the walls. The family called this creature Gef, and, after a few months, it allegedly started to talk and sing songs in several languages, including Manx. According to Voirrey, Gef had told her he was a mongoose, originally from Delhi and in his seventies.\n It was not until a local woman from Peel contacted the famous ghost hunter, Harry Price, that this ‘thing’ gained wider notoriety. The Daily Mail newspaper loved the story and the ‘talking mongoose of the Isle of Man’ turned into a fad.\n Harry Price, by all accounts, took it seriously and travelled to the Isle of Man to interrogate Voirrey Irivin, but he did not see the animal for himself. He gave the family a camera with which to take any pictures of Gef, should he choose to show himself. In the event, the image they managed to capture could just as well have been a rag.\n(Image: The Spooky Isles)\n Harry Price then went on to write a book on this phenomenon, The Haunting of Cashen’s Gap, along with Richard Lambert who worked for the BBC and was subsequently fired by them. He was awarded indemnities in a Court of Law in 1936.\n In 1935, Reginald Pocock of the Natural History Museum examined some paw prints in Vaseline, said to have come from Gef, and asserted that they had probably not been made by an animal. A bit of hair, also allegedly from the mongoose, turned out to be actually from the Irving family’s collie. Then came the Second World War, people had other things to worry about, and Gef slowly disappeared from collective memory. The Irving farmhouse has long since vanished.\n It must be noted that, in the Isle of Man, mongooses did occur in the wild for some years, after a local farmer had released a few in 1912. It is therefore quite possible there were still some Manx mongooses around in 1931.\n For a fuller account of events, see Jenny Randles (2003), Supernatural Isle of Man. London: Robert Hale.\n"

    "question": "Will Node.js replace many backend technologies?",
    "answer": "Node.js will continue to expand as a back end technology - it has the unique advantage over other back end technologies that it can flexibly move processing back and forth between back and front end by using technologies like server side rendering. And if you are deep into a JavaScript front end stack like React, using node.js a fair bit in your front end code too, combining that with a server side JavaScript stack makes a lot of sense - and anode clearly doesn’t really have much in the way of competition as a JavaScript run time environment.\n Does this mean Node.is is inevitable or will keep growing forever? No, plenty of other technologies are growing too. Within a few years WASM stacks as a front end (and even as lightweight powerful portable containerisation alternative) will be big, reducing the need for every full stack app to have a JavaScript front end. Lots of people still consider native front ends worth taking the time to develop separately for each platform. Flutter still exists. Plenty of technologies exist that allow the developer to avoid thinking about JavaScript as much as possible by transpiling some completely different language into JavaScript and so keep back and front end in the same language that way, enabling a whole different set of advantages (eg Clojure and ClojureScript). Sometimes a really great back end is worth keeping even if it restricts some of the front end optimisation that is possible, and while many people really like what’s possible with full stack JavaScript, lots of people hate the idea of full stack JavaScript.\n So, yes it will, but it’s not the only trend that is happening. It’s pretty much taking over any other use of Javascipt server side/middleware and that’s not everything.\n"

    "question": "What is the need for a welding fume extractor?",
    "answer": "The need for a [LINKED_TEXT: welding fume extractor] [URL: https://www.powertechpollutioncontrols.com/products/fumekiller/] arises from the potential health hazards associated with welding processes. When metals are welded, heated, or cut, they release various hazardous substances into the air in the form of welding fumes and gases. These fumes can be harmful when inhaled, leading to various health issues. Here are the key reasons why a welding fume extractor is necessary:\nWorker Health Protection: Welding fumes contain harmful substances, such as metal oxides, ozone, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds. Prolonged exposure to these fumes can cause respiratory problems, eye irritation, throat irritation, and can even lead to long-term health conditions like metal fume fever or lung diseases. A welding fume extractor helps protect the health of welders and other workers in the vicinity by capturing and removing these harmful particles at the source.Compliance with Health and Safety Regulations: Many countries have strict workplace health and safety regulations that require employers to control and limit exposure to hazardous substances, including welding fumes. Failing to comply with these regulations can result in legal and financial consequences. Using a welding fume extractor is an essential measure to meet these regulatory requirements and ensure a safe working environment.Indoor Air Quality: Welding fumes can contaminate the air in the workspace, leading to poor indoor air quality. This can affect not only the welders but also other employees working nearby. A welding fume extractor improves the overall air quality in the workplace by removing harmful particles, creating a safer and more comfortable environment for everyone.Preventing Cross-Contamination: In many industrial settings, different welding processes may occur simultaneously or in close proximity to each other. Without proper extraction, welding fumes can spread to other work areas, contaminating the air and exposing workers who are not directly involved in welding tasks. A fume extractor helps contain the fumes and prevents cross-contamination.Equipment Longevity: Welding fumes can deposit on welding equipment and machinery, leading to corrosion and premature wear and tear. A fume extractor helps keep the equipment clean and extends its lifespan, reducing maintenance costs and downtime.Enhancing Productivity: Providing a safe and healthy working environment improves worker morale and productivity. When workers feel that their health is protected, they are more likely to focus on their tasks and perform better.Environmental Concerns: Welding fumes, if not properly controlled, can contribute to air pollution. By using a welding fume extractor, businesses can reduce their environmental impact and demonstrate a commitment to sustainability.\n"

    "question": "When should you not use serverless?",
    "answer": "Many businesses today embrace the serverless approach, but does your company need this relatively recent innovation?\n The serverless approach is not meant for business processes built on blockchain or monolith architectures. These types of architectures don't allow the system to split into separate microservices and have highly voluminous applications, which do not fit the serverless approach, where functions should launch fast and run for a short amount of time. In addition, some programming frameworks, such as Java Spring, also can't be used with the serverless approach.\n Additional points that can stop you from applying serverless in your business are the fear of the unknown and the need for the right staff to help you step on the serverless track for the first time. The last concern deserves to be highlighted: even though serverless should be \"easier,\" it still takes team expertise to be competent in a new tool.\n Are you looking to capitalize on the benefits of serverless?

    "question": "What are the common mistakes students do while preparing for GATE?",
    "answer": "GATE is one of the toughest exams of the country either for joining a PSU or for doing M.tech. The questions are prepared by the iit professors themselves so naturally the level is a bit on the higher side as compared to other exams.  Some of the most common mistakes that students commit are:  Underestimating yourself- Many a times you panic seeing the fierce competition and loose your flow of preparation. Remember that everything comes at a cost. So you need to be fully focussed to achieve your targets and not think of the huge lot because only 10–15% will be serious aspirants.  Proper revision- this is an eternal part of your preparation. Even the topper forgets so you are no special. Not let the gap of revision of a subject exceed more than 15 days.  Reading everything- to score a good rank in gate you don’t need to study everything but only focus on the concepts and practice more and more to achieve perfection. You don’t need to prove that you are a scientist. Just don’t study anything out of syllabus  Demotivation- sometimes you may feel demotivated at times due to poor performance in test series despite hard work..don’t get demotivated. Just watch some motivational videos from toppers and experienced counsellors and keep your spirits high.  Underestimating the test series- you have to understand the importance of test series. It helps you analyse your mistakes and shows where you really stand among the whole lot. Don’t be the frog of your own well.  Competition- The only competition you have is with yourself. Don't try to compare your marks with your friends. It might demotivate you. Just try to score higher than your previous performance.  Fb and social media- Use it wisely. Don't get too involved in it. Once you get a 2 digit rank in gate..all your social profiles will be updated themselves. Don't worry  Make friends wisely- have a good company. Never make friends with pessimist guys or girls. When you have a good company of friends you can have fruitful discussions on different topics. Try to be in contact with atleast two or three good friends preparing together.  Finally its the D day that will decide your rank. You have to keep calm in the last moments. Take a proper sleep before going for the exam and have that confidence and fire in you.   And a great rank awaits you.. All the best.\n For self preparation tips go through the link below:\n [LINKED_TEXT: How does own preparation really help to crack the GATE 2019?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/unanswered/How-does-own-preparation-really-help-to-crack-the-GATE-2019]\n [LINKED_TEXT: android app ->Exam Prep (Eng/Hindi) SSC CGL | IBPS | Bank PO | GATE | CTET | NEET] [URL: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?hl=en&id=co.gradeup.android]\n [LINKED_TEXT: blog -> Civil Engineering: Exams/ Jobs/ Subjects/ Books/ Preparation] [URL: https://gradeup.co/civil-engineering]\n Study Smart, Score Better on Gradeup.\n"

    "question": "If NASA finds a fossil on Mars, how long would they wait to tell the public and does this instantly confirm alien life?",
    "answer": "Hard to know, really. It'd rather depends on what's going on with NASA at the time and what the political climate is. The truth is that NASA does sometimes release certain information somewhat prematurely just because it spurs interest in what NASA is doing. Certainly they are very careful not to claim things that aren't true. But it would be expected that they would release photos of something they say that some scientists are speculating could be a fossil.\n The truth is that there could be a lot of debate as to what they have found really is. Remember many years ago when that Mars Rock was found on Earth that had what some scientists were speculating could be fossils? It took a very long time for most scientists to be convinced that they were not fossils, and even at that there's still some debate on the subject. If potential fossils are found on Mars, it could take years of study to establish whether or not they are truly fossils. NASA certainly isn't going to sit on the information for all that time.\n"

    "question": "Were there any Western equivalents to the Japanese Samurai? What is the closest?",
    "answer": "Knights are extremely similar.\nThis is true both in terms of social class and military role.\nKnights and samurai both occupied a social status distinctly above peasants, artisans, and merchants.Knights and samurai both were usually pledged to feudal lords who owned land. They could in some cases have land of their own, and in other cases could be itinerant and seeking a lord to support them.Knights and samurai were generally permitted to carry swords throughout the feudal period, even in times and places when sword laws were fairly restrictive.Knights and samurai both varied wildly in terms of income and earnings.Knights and samurai both had a generally hereditary status and were usually trained from an early age, but that status could be earned by someone lower-born.Both usually fought wars from horseback while wearing the heaviest available armor.Both had a dueling culture among peers.Both were supposed to hold to a code of honorable behavior (bushido, chivalry).\nThere are not really very many easy distinctions to make between knights and samurai other than some very particular details.\nArchery was a much bigger part of the repertoire of samurai than it was for knights. This isn’t actually a very big deal in the big picture. Then there are also an assortment of specific cultural details, like the whole Christianity thing and religious orders of knights.\n On the whole, if you look at the diverse range of details for knights at various times and places in European history, it’s pretty hard to say that samurai aren’t pretty much the Japanese version of knights.\n"

    "question": "ECB departing head Draghi insists that Germany and the Netherlands simply must spend more in the struggling EZ. What are the chances?",
    "answer": "Mr Draghi probably has more chance to be heard in Germany than in the Netherlands. The Dutch economy is still doing pretty well and does not really need stimulus. In fact employers have trouble finding suitable people to fill jobs. Another thing is that the country has made considerable sacrifices to bring down its national debt below the recommended 60% level and it does not want to go back into more debt. Some of the effects of earlier cuts are only now coming to the surface especially in the lower tiers of government, like the municipalities. They have been saddled with a lot of responsibilities without being given the means to carry them out properly. Education has considerable and structural funding problems. There was a rather rare strike about that today. Perhaps that The Hague will try to redress some of their grievances and also increase military spending, but with a VVD led coalition it will jealously guard its purse strings. The country is already the per capita biggest net payer into EU coffers -and has been for a long time- and is getting pretty tired of other EU governments treating it as a general purpose Santa Claus, while biting the hand that feeds them. No matter what Draghi says.\n"

    "question": "How come the AAP got massive public support in Punjab politics so quickly?",
    "answer": "AAP willl rule many States over the next few years even if they cannot win any elections outright in 2022 or 2024\n Their Popularity is rising by the day in many states like Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand\n Why is this so?\n Simple\n People are Tired of the Established Parties\n Its why they Voted for Modi many times\n But Today Modi is also failing many of them. He is also seen as a Politician who talks and lies and who does nothing for the Common man but boasts of everything he has done.\n They like AAP because AAP represents “Real Common Man”\n Teachers, Small Businessmen, Carpenters, Social Service Workers, Retired Civil Servants, Retired Cops - They are all One of the People.\n Not the Badal Family (SAD)\n Not the INC which is full of Gandhi Sycophants\n Not the BJP which is full of Hindutva Nodding Lackeys\nKejriwal is a Different Type of Leader\n A Man of Action\n And he solves Common Mans Problems\n You have a School Issue, your AAP MLA sorts it out\n You have a Power Issue, you can visit your AAP MLA and they will handle it for you (Power as in Electricity not Satta power)\n During COVID Phase II - Retired Bank Staff say how well AAP organized and ran Delhi and how Medicines came to them through AAP Volunteers\nNow of course - the Propaganda Machinery will be against him.\n AK is not Rahul Gandhi\n He is a Tough Cookie and deals with BJPs Propaganda better than anyone else\nWhether AK is suitable to be a National Leader?\n Of course he is\n He is competent and Qualified\n He plans his Freebies strategically. He does real research on Things.\n No matter how hard BJP try - they cannot fault him despite all the rumours on Oxygen crisis. He simply did his job for his people in Delhi, Modi and Harshvardhan didnt do their Job for the People in India.\nSo the Public Support of AAP is simply because\n (a) They are different\n (b) They come from Common People\n (c) They actually do work for the People instead of sitting on Dynastic Thrones like the INC or Dreaming about Grandiose Uneconomic Visions like BJP\n In short - They are Long Term Assets for the Nation\n"

    "question": "What Tom Clancy games are not based off (or even related to) actual Tom Clancy books?",
    "answer": "A lot of people are saying that only Rainbow Six, R6 Vegas, and R6 Vegas 2 are the only ones, but that’s not ENTIRELY true.\n R6 Siege is based on the same team that John Clark founded back in 1999, it just takes place a couple decades later. In universe, Rainbow was disbanded in 2012, then reformed in 2015, but story-wise, the book and games are all one continuous series. AFAIK, even Rainbow Six Siege’s Containment event technically takes place in the series, though the game series has had spinoffs that don’t take place in the same timeline, namely EndWar and Extraction.\n Ghost Recon isn’t based on any actual book made by Tom Clancy, but it certainly is inspired by it. Political tensions with Russia, tactical special forces teams, the CIA. It’s impossible NOT to see the connections to the Ryanverse.\n Additionally, because the R6 book takes place in the Ryanverse, and the R6 games are treated as direct sequels to the book, AND Ghost Recon Wildlands not only takes place in the same universe, it actually shares a number of characters, namely FBI SWAT team leader Eliza Cohen, GIGN operator Emmanuelle Pichon, Navy SEAL Meghan Castellano, BOPE operator Taina Pereira, SAS operator Mike Baker, and Lera Malkinova.\n Same with the Splinter Cell series. Not necessarily based on a book, but A. very clearly inspired by Clancy’s novels, and B. We know for a fact that it takes place in the Ryanverse along with R6.\n Now, it’s easy to assume that this means that every crossover in a Ghost Recon game signifies that that also takes place in the same universe, the Ryanverse, but it’s not really true. We know that GR and R6 take place in the same universe because Ubisoft outright told us. That doesn’t meant that The Predator or The Terminator take place in the same universe, because those were clearly just afterthoughts tied in, neither was based on the other.\n That being said, Tom Clancy’s The Division is much less so based on Clancy novels. Yes, we see special forces operators, espionage, and secret military units working with the U.S. government, but we also know for a fact that it’s NOT in the Ryanverse, so no reason treating it the same.\n"

    "question": "How do you think the history of the United States might have developed differently if John Adams had won reelection and defeated Thomas Jefferson in the electoral college in 1800?",
    "answer": "It would depend greatly on what happened in the NEXT election after that, 1804. Would Jefferson have gotten upset, stormed off, and retire from politics forever? And without Jefferson, would his party have just broken up? It is hard to know.\n We do know that Jefferson’s election in 1800 had important effects. It was the first transition of power from one party to the opposition, and it was ultimately peaceful. Not a single shot was fired. Adams, in contrast, had wanted to continue Washington’s administration and did not, at first, change a single Cabinet member.\n The danger of an Adams victory might have been a sense that one party — the Federalist Party — achieved so much success that from then on, one-party government might well have become the rule, and it might have been the Federalist Party in power for a long time.\n Instead, the Federalist Party went away, but eventually other parties (such as the Whigs) arose to fill in the gap.\n Another effect of Adams’ re-election might have been the perception that the Alien & Sedition Acts were seen as just fine, even though it was a huge violation of the first amendment… (but the Supreme Court, at this point, didn’t feel the confidence to take on such a law).\n As it was, Jefferson and his party came to control the national government as a result of the election of 1800, and they overturned the Alien and Sedition Acts as quickly as they could.\n One other effect: The 12th amendment might not have been passed when it was (1802). The electoral college created a mess, because the Jeffersonians wanted Jefferson for president, Aaron Burr for Vice. But under the whacky original system (making the electoral college even worse than it is now), electors cast two undifferentiated votes — and they forgot to withhold one of their votes for Burr.\n This created a tie in the electoral college between Jefferson and Burr, the election then went to the House of Representatives, which in turn was tied for many ballots, and it nearly destroyed the system. The 12th amendment was passed and ratified to straighten some of this out.\n"

    "question": "What is the difference between Tesla's autopilot system and Google's driver-less car? How on earth did Tesla manage to pull this off, while other companies - including Google - have been trying to do it for years?",
    "answer": "They are quite different.\n Google's system uses an expensive 64-beam LIDAR to localize itself to within 10cm on a detailed pre-existing map.  It's incredibly precise.  It also uses the LIDAR data to build a 360 degree world model that tracks and predicts movements for all nearby vehicles, pedestrians, and other obstacles, so it's able to plan intelligent paths through complex highway or urban environments.\n Tesla's system is reportedly based on monocular forward-looking camera technology from Mobileye.  This means it's very unlikely that Tesla's system can localize itself on a map, at least to the degree needed to accomplish lane keeping (GPS isn't reliable enough).  However, the forward-looking camera can pick up the location and curvature of highway lane makers, which is more than enough to simply keep the car in its lane and accomplish basic lane change maneuvers.\n Each of these systems excels in its own domain.  Tesla's is low-cost and will likely be effective at accomplishing Elon Musk's goal of automating 90% of driving within a few years.  But handling the last 10% of driving situations is very, very hard.  Google created the 90% solution years ago and accurately predicted others would follow soon after, so they decided to focus on solving the really hard problems that will give them a major, potentially even monopolistic advantage in the long run.\n"

    "question": "Why did D-Day boats open in the front?",
    "answer": "Because if they opened at the back or the sides everybody would fall out into deep water and drown. Incidentally they’re still made that way today for the same reasons. It’s the only way you can unload troops or cargo from a boat onto the beach:\nYou may have watched the movie Saving Private Ryan and seen this scene where German MGs fired directly into the boats:\nThat scene isn’t very accurate. First of all those are American Higgins boats, while the actual landing on that part of Omaha was made with Royal Navy Landing Craft Assault (LCA) boats. They’re similar enough that it’s not a big deal though. The real issue is that the view from an actual German MG bunker on Omaha Beach looked like this:\nThey actually fired sideways along the beach, not down it. Any German gun positions facing out to sea like they were in the movie would have got plastered by Allied warships before the troops even landed. Instead they couldn’t easily be seen from the sea and when the troops got off the boats the fire would have been coming from the side, not in front. In fact, in many places the bullets would have been coming from both sides at once, which is obviously bad.\n The front ramp on the LCA was in exactly the right place to do its job. The problem the troops had wasn’t the boats, it was that they were making an opposed landing against a well dug in enemy and they all got dropped in a confused mess on the wrong part of the beach with no armoured support. That’s a tough day at the office for anyone.\n"

    "question": "What will happen if you're right next to Earth in space and you throw a ball towards it?",
    "answer": "For the sake of this example, let us assume you are holding a baseball while you are orbiting the Earth. If you are orbiting the Earth at 250 miles up, traveling at 17,500 mph (28,000 km/h), and you throw a baseball toward the Earth, what will happen to the baseball?\n 17,500 mph (28,000 km/h) is the speed you must travel at 250 miles up to maintain an orbit around Earth.\n An average person can throw a baseball at approximately [LINKED_TEXT: 25 miles per hour] [URL: https://www.cgaa.org/articles/how-fast-can-an-average-person-throw-a-baseball]. However, different people have different throwing speeds. Since Earth is the target and it’s 250 miles away, it would take an object 600 minutes, or 10 hours to travel 250 miles.\n Meanwhile, every 90 minutes, the baseball will completely orbit the Earth, miss the Earth, and go around for another try. Essentially, the baseball will enter into an elliptical orbit around Earth and never hit the ground until the very thin atmosphere at 250 miles altitude slows the baseball enough that it de-orbits and enters the atmosphere, and this could take many months.\n The reason the baseball never reaches the Earth is that the baseball still has a forward velocity of 17,500 mph relative to the Earth's gravity, and as a result, it will follow a curved path around the planet.\nLet’s say you’re an astronaut who is the best baseball pitcher in the world. Assuming that you are traveling at 17,500 mph relative to the Earth when you throw the baseball, and the baseball is thrown in the opposite direction to the spacecraft's forward momentum at a velocity of 17,500 mph relative to the astronaut, the baseball's velocity relative to the Earth would be zero.\n In this case, the baseball would not have any forward velocity relative to the Earth, and it would fall towards the planet due to the force of gravity. The baseball would likely burn up in the Earth's atmosphere during re-entry, but it would not remain in orbit around the Earth.\n"

    "question": "Where does all the carbon dioxide go in a submarine?",
    "answer": "A submarine is a complex machine that operates underwater for long periods of time. One of the challenges of submarine design is how to deal with the carbon dioxide (CO2) that is produced by the crew and the engines. CO2 is a gas that can cause health problems and even death if it accumulates in high concentrations. Therefore, submarines need a way to remove CO2 from the air and prevent it from building up inside the vessel.\n There are different methods that submarines use to eliminate CO2, depending on their type and technology. Some of the most common ones are:\n - Scrubbers: These are devices that use chemical reactions to absorb CO2 from the air and convert it into harmless substances, such as water and sodium carbonate. Scrubbers are usually installed in the ventilation system of the submarine and require regular maintenance and replenishment of chemicals.\n - Electrolysis: This is a process that uses electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is used to replenish the air supply, while the hydrogen is either vented out or stored for later use. Electrolysis also reduces the amount of CO2 in the air, since water is one of the products of combustion.\n - Carbon capture and storage: This is a technique that involves capturing CO2 from the air and storing it in a solid or liquid form, such as calcium carbonate or liquid CO2. This method requires advanced technology and large storage tanks, but it has the advantage of reducing the weight and volume of CO2 on board.\n These are some of the ways that submarines manage to keep their air quality safe and comfortable for their crew and passengers. Submarines are remarkable examples of engineering and innovation that allow humans to explore and operate in the underwater environment.\n"

That put him in the company of the popular British music echelons of musicians and performers. He was given the chance to expand and blossom musically with the Jimi Hendrix Experience. The ‘Are You Experience?’, ‘Axis Bold As Love’ and ‘Electric Ladyland’ albums influenced the popular music soundscape. Nothing like it had been heard before that time. His live performances displayed his ‘new musical form’ that still resonates to this day among many guitarist and music performers of all genres of popular music\n"

    "question": "How does a visually impaired computer programmer program?",
    "answer": "A visually impaired computer programmer codes the same way any other developer. The only difference here is that they use assistive technologies to access the computer and the programming language. These assistive technologies include a screen reader, braille display, or speech recognition software.\n The role of the screen reader is to read the content on the screen through raised dots. And the speech recognition software interprets the spoken commands and translates them into typed commands.\n Here, website accessibility also plays an important role, as visually impaired individuals won't be able to code if the software or website they are using to code is not accessible to these assistive technologies.\n This also allows visually impaired programmers to customize their computer environment and programming language. For instance, they can increase their screen's font size or contrast or adjust their text editor to be more accessible. This includes increasing the verbal feedback the software receives when typing in commands or even adding text-to-speech for commands and feedback.\n Some zooming software also allows visually impaired programmers to zoom in on text and other elements of the user interface, making them easier to see.\n With the help of different accessible IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), visually impaired individuals can easily program. This software includes features such as keyboard navigation, text-to-speech, and braille support.\n Here are some examples of visually impaired computer programmers who have made significant contributions to the field:\nRay Kurzweil: Ray Kurzweil is a blind American computer scientist and futurist. He is best known for his work on artificial intelligence, speech recognition, and text-to-speech software.Daniel Kish: Daniel Kish is a blind American man who uses echolocation to navigate the world. He is the founder of World Access for the Blind, a non-profit organization that provides training and support for blind people who want to learn echolocation.\nThe above are only a few examples; there might be a lot more visually impaired individuals who are successful programmers.\n These are some ways in which visually impaired computer programmers can program more easily and effectively. With the use of assistive technology and website accessibility, they can now have equal access to programming language, and by adjusting their environment, they can make the entire programming experience more accessible and comfortable.\n"

    "question": "Who generally writes the documentation for software?",
    "answer": "There is no definitive answer to this question, it will depend on various things like size of your project/company, complexity of the software etc.\n It’s ideal to have a dedicated Technical Document writers to cover your software product documentation, sometimes it’s not feasible to have a dedicated resource for this, so software engineers, QA engineers, support people tend to write the product documentation.\n In some instances, writing a technical documentation requires quite in-depth knowledge about the software, technology stack etc, in such instances it’s best the software engineers who implemented the functionality write the documentation as well, you’ll frequently see this on some of the Microsoft documentation ex: [LINKED_TEXT: IoT real-time data streams and Azure Stream Analytics] [URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-get-started-with-azure-stream-analytics-to-process-data-from-iot-devices] where it requires a lot of code samples and the documentation is quite technical.\n"

    "question": "Did Alexander the Great speak Macedonian?",
    "answer": "“Did Alexander the Great speak Macedonian?”\n Of course, Alexander spoke Macedonian, which was a dialect of Greek, not a distinct language. Recent archaeological excavations have revealed more than 5000 inscriptions in Greek on grave stelae and votive offerings. The inscriptions from Macedonia are all written either in Common Attic (Koine) Greek, or a Greek dialect showing affinities both with the north-western (Doric) Greek dialects of Epirus and with the north-eastern (Aeolic) Greek dialects of Thessaly.\n “The language of the Macedonians was a distinct and particular form of Greek, resistant to outside influences and conservative in pronunciation. It remained so until the fourth century when it was almost totally submerged by the flood tide of standardized Greek.” (Nicholas Hammond, British scholar and expert on Macedon, “A History of Macedonia”, Vol. ii, 550-336 BC)\n “The evidence for the language of the Macedonians has been reviewed and discussed by Kalleris and Hammond, Griffith, and many others, all contending that it was a dialect of Greek. The increasing volume of surviving public and private inscriptions makes it quite clear that there was no written language but Greek. There may be room for argument over spoken forms, or at least over local survivals of earlier occupancy, but it is hard to imagine what kind of authority might sustain that. There is no evidence for a different “Macedonian” language that cannot be as easily explained in terms of dialect or accent.” (“Cambridge Ancient Histories”, Cambridge Univ. Press, 1998)﻿\n The Digital Library of Language Relationships, classifies Macedonian as a Hellenic (Greek) language. Not to be confused with the modern North Macedonian language, which is related to the Bulgarian language:\n “Name: Ancient Macedonian.\n Parent Subgroup: Hellenic (Greek).\n Brief Description: The ancient language of the Macedonian kingdom in N. Greece and modern Macedonia during the later 1st millennium BC. Survived until the early 1st millennium AD. Not to be confused with the modern Macedonian language, which is a close relative of the Slavic Bulgarian.

    "question": "Why is recycling mobile phones important?",
    "answer": "Yes, you should definitely recycle your old smartphone. Recycling your smartphone is an environmentally responsible thing to do, and it can also benefit you in a number of ways. Here are some of the reasons why recycling your old smartphone is a good idea.\n Reduce e-waste\n Smartphones, like all electronic devices, contain a variety of materials that can be harmful to the environment if they are not disposed of properly. Recycling your old smartphone ensures that these materials are reused or disposed of in a safe and environmentally responsible way, reducing the amount of electronic waste that ends up in landfills.\n Conserve resources\n By recycling your old smartphone, you are also helping to conserve valuable resources. Many of the materials used to make smartphones, such as copper, silver, and gold, are non-renewable resources that are becoming increasingly scarce. By recycling your old smartphone, you are helping to reduce the demand for these resources and preserve them for future generations.\n Protect your personal information\n Your smartphone contains a lot of personal information, including your contacts, emails, and other sensitive data. If you simply throw your old phone away, this information could potentially be accessed by someone else. Recycling your old smartphone ensures that your personal information is securely wiped from the device before it is reused or recycled.\n If your smartphone is no longer functional or is too old to be useful, recycling it is the best option. Many electronics retailers and recycling centers accept old smartphones for recycling. Be sure to check with your local recycling center to see if they accept smartphones and what their specific requirements are.\n [LINKED_TEXT: Recycling of mobile phones] [URL: https://www.everythingmobilelimited.com/mobile-phone-recycling/] is a simple but important way to reduce e-waste, conserve resources, and protect your personal information. By trading in, donating, or recycling your old phone, you can ensure that it is disposed of in an environmentally responsible way while also benefiting yourself or others.\n"

    "question": "Should gun owners and their children be put into reeducation camps?",
    "answer": "No, it is not appropriate to put gun owners and their children into reeducation camps simply because they own guns. Such an action would violate basic human rights and freedoms, including the right to own property and the right to freedom of thought and expression. Additionally, it is not an effective or ethical way to address concerns about gun ownership.\n Instead, a more productive approach to addressing concerns about gun ownership would be to promote responsible and safe gun ownership practices through education and training programs. This can help ensure that gun owners and their families are aware of the potential dangers of firearms and are equipped with the knowledge and skills to use them safely.\n It is important to remember that gun ownership is a complex issue that requires thoughtful and nuanced consideration. Any efforts to address this issue should be rooted in respect for individual rights and freedoms, as well as a commitment to promoting public safety and well-being.\n For more articles related to tourism please visit\n[LINKED_TEXT: NOWRUZ 2023   Nowruz: Celebrating the New Year and the Renewal of Nature Nowruz, or the Persian New Year, is a festival that has been celebrated for tho...https://indiantourism98.blogspot.com/2023/03/nowruz-celebrating-new-year-and-renewal.html?m=1] [URL: https://indiantourism98.blogspot.com/2023/03/nowruz-celebrating-new-year-and-renewal.html?m=1]"

    "question": "Who usually holds the rights to old classical instrumental composition Beethoven, Mozart, etc.?",
    "answer": "Nobody does. Those compositions are in the public domain.\n However, don’t make the rookie mistake of assuming that because those compositions can be played by anyone without having to pay anyone anything, that therefore recordings of those compositions are also in the public domain.\n Recordings are different. If you want to use a recording of a work by a composer from that era, you have to find out if the recording is in the public domain. Chances are, it won’t be. This means that you will have to pay for the rights to use the recording.\n If you don’t want to do that, you can of course record musicians playing that music.\n But you’d better pay them, and sort out the rights in the recording that you make of them playing it.\n Unless, that is, you can play it yourself, from the sheet music, in which case the rights are between you the producer and you the performer.\n Then again, some texts of the music of these composers may not be in the public domain. It then depends on what edition you’re using. This is not usually a problem with most works, because the differences between one text and another will likely be inaudible to most listeners.\n But the main point is this: the actual music of composers from the eras of Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, etc. is in the public domain.\n But that doesn’t mean you can use any recording of it for free.\n If you find this situation confusing, say so in the comments and further enlightenment will be provided.\n"

    "question": "What is Digital Wealth Management?",
    "answer": "Established financial advisers employ digital tools to create unified client experiences across all user devices and platforms, which is referred to as digital wealth management. These tools contribute to improved financial asset performance by increasing engagement and transparency, fostering collaboration, and fostering increased engagement and transparency.\n Financial advisors may use digital wealth management to build seamless client experiences across all devices and platforms, allowing them to scale solutions to reach a larger number of customers. High-touch consulting has always been an important component of the advisor-client relationship; however, in the digital era, clients need financial advisers to quickly learn about their requirements, preferences, and objectives to deliver personalized financial advice. The financial services industry's digitization allows companies to share data-driven insights with advisers, encouraging engagement and strengthening partnerships. When it comes to leveraging digital technologies to communicate with clients, wealth management organizations encounter a shared set of issues, many of which are related to data collection. Most businesses' client contacts are defined by a large amount of data that is often fragmented and dispersed throughout the organization. It's also more difficult to give tailored insights and relevant services due to a lack of third-party data (on spending and saving habits, values, and interests, as well as related transactional data). Data-driven insights and the ability to engage in cross-channel strategic messaging are two benefits of connecting businesses with automated marketing tools and technologies.\n Fintech companies are providing new capabilities and techniques to empower technology and expertise to improve customer engagement and corporate performance. The primary drivers of digital change in wealth management are listed below:\nSwitch to digital: According to numerous surveys, 40% of modern investors desire digital access to their accounts, and 80% prefer to manage their investments and contact advisors using mobile applications.Costs and fee pressure: Transparency about fees and compensation puts downward pressure on fees, but the massive assault of regulatory requirements drives up expenses in the traditional business model.Competition: Digital wealth management firms are challenging the traditional wealth management model by providing more personalized and efficient digital experiences that align with shifting customer expectations.Technology: Through mobile interaction, analytics, and service delivery, technology allows innovative capabilities. It provides a consistent context for interactions across channels that may be automated, as well as enhanced access to data sources that are otherwise inaccessible to make routine process decisions.\n"

    "question": "How hard is it to trace a VPN?",
    "answer": "VPN (Virtual Private Network) connections can be traced through several methods, but it's important to note that tracing a VPN connection is not a straightforward process and typically requires technical expertise and access to specific information.\n Here are some of the methods that can be used to trace a VPN connection:\nIP address tracking: The IP address assigned to a device by a VPN provider can be used to determine the general location of the device, but it can be difficult to determine the specific identity of the person using the VPN connection. However, it's worth noting that some VPN providers keep logs of the IP addresses assigned to their users, which can be used to trace a VPN connection.Traffic analysis: The traffic generated by a VPN connection can be analyzed to determine the source and destination of the data being transmitted. This can be done by analyzing the characteristics of the data, such as the type and volume of traffic, and cross-referencing it with other information.Malicious software: Malicious software, such as malware or spyware, can be used to monitor and collect information about a VPN connection, including the source and destination of the data being transmitted.Cooperation with ISPs and other organizations: Tracing a VPN connection may also require the cooperation of internet service providers (ISPs) and other organizations, such as law enforcement agencies, that have access to additional information and technical resources.\nIt's worth noting that while VPN connections can be traced, they offer a higher level of privacy and security compared to using the internet without a VPN. However, to ensure the highest level of privacy and security, it's important to choose a reputable and trustworthy VPN provider that has a strong privacy policy and does not keep logs of user activity.\n"

    "question": "What is polarisation by dichroism?",
    "answer": "Great question, which really asks for some discussion of the origin and nature of dichroism. And since there are two types, linear dichroism and circular dichroism, let’s be specific and note that it’s the first of these two (linear) that’s at play here.\n First, the name dichroism itself suggests an effect related to color. But that is not what leads to polarization. Polarization arises from differences in absorption. So let’s start there, and for the moment let’s talk about monochromatic light only.\n In some (crystalline) anisotropic materials there is a dipole moment associated with electron transitions in the constituent molecules, and it has a preferred orientation with respect to the structure of the molecule. What that means is that the likelihood of a transition (absorption or emission) will depend on the orientation of the molecule with respect to the electric field. Simply put, linearly polarized light will be absorbed more or less, according to its orientation (azimuth).\n The anisotropy therefore manifests itself as presenting to linearly polarized light two different absorption coefficients. Thus, as unpolarized light travels through a material exhibiting dichroism, the transmitted light becomes increasingly partially linearly polarized, with the polarized component aligned with the direction for which the absorption coefficient is smaller.\n Another effect can be seen. If the incident is already linearly polarized and not aligned with either of the absorption axes, the transmitted light will maintain its linear polarization but be rotated toward the axis showing less absorption. Thus linear dichroism presents one form of optical activity.\n But why was the effect given a name (dichroism) related to color? The answer lies in the fact that the magnitude of the differential absorption can depend on wavelength. That is, dichroism can exhibit dispersion. As a result, when white light passes through tourmaline and is viewed through a polarizer, the observed color of the transmitted light changes as the polarizer is rotated. One can imagine this being the first observation that was made on such crystals, and so the effect was given a color-related name, which stuck.\n"

    "question": "Rep. Jim Jordan (GOP) said that it’s the President’s call to use his private lawyer as the point man for foreign policy instead of a duly appointed cabinet official. Is he correct?",
    "answer": "There are many ways of negotiating anything. There are often informal discussions about having a discussion. Informal discussions cover the widest range of topics so that when an advance is made to holding formal discussions much of the chaff has been removed from the wheat. This saves time and effort.\n In the original transcript which was released Trump made it clear that he trusted Mr Giuliani as his lawyer and a person that was generally knowledgeable. Nothing more, not a diplomat or as anyone with plenipotentiary powers to negotiate anything. He is just someone Trump trusted to carry a message. The classic case of informal discussion.\n Trump obviously did not trust Obama’s choice for an ambassador and by that time she was out of the picture in any event. The President of Ukraine felt that getting rid or her was a good thing as she had been unable to establish a working relationship with him. So building confidence was a big part of what Rudy was going to be doing. There is nothing wrong with that at all. That’s what politicians and lawyers do.\n"

    "question": "Do childhood vaccinations cause autism? My daughter in law is refusing to vaccinate her children based on this belief.",
    "answer": "It’s possible.\n Many other answers here lack context and a detailed discussion of the matter.\n Let’s begin with the story of Hannah Poling.\nFrom the CBS article:\n “Hannah was described as normal, happy and precocious in her first 18 months.\n Then, in July 2000, she was vaccinated against nine diseases in one doctor's visit: measles, mumps, rubella, polio, varicella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and Haemophilus influenzae.\n Afterward, her health declined rapidly. She developed high fevers, stopped eating, didn't respond when spoken to, began showing signs of autism, and began having screaming fits. In 2002, Hannah's parents filed an autism claim in federal vaccine court. Five years later, the government settled the case before trial and had it sealed. It's taken more than two years for both sides to agree on how much Hannah will be compensated for her injuries.\n[LINKED_TEXT: https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/03/06/eveningnews/main3915703.shtml] [URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/03/06/eveningnews/main3915703.shtml]In acknowledging Hannah's injuries, the government said vaccines aggravated an unknown mitochondrial disorder Hannah had which didn't \"cause\" her autism, but \"resulted\" in it. It's unknown how many other children have similar undiagnosed mitochondrial disorder. All other autism ‘test cases’ have been defeated at trial. Approximately 4,800 are awaiting disposition in federal vaccine court.”\n So it seems there are pre-existing conditions that can be exacerbated by vaccination leading to autism, such as in Hannah’s case.\n Arguably, the vaccines were causal in her case. We can examine the counterfactual to determine the truth - if she were not given the vaccines, then she would not have developed autism in the given timeframe.\n Many other answers then fail to cite an important fact - there was never an investigation into vaccine safety based on the knowledge of mitochondrial disease.\n Unfortunately, medicine is not too keen to undertake such an investigation.\n On the other hand, as part of receipt for compensation, the Polings were told to keep silent under a gag order. This might tell you something about the state of affairs our society is in.\n You can’t find evidence unless you earnestly look for it. The “absence of evidence” is not evidence that something cannot happen.\n So it is possible.\n[LINKED_TEXT: Family to Receive $1.5M+ in First-Ever Vaccine-Autism Court AwardFamily of Hannah Poling will Receive More than $1.5 Million in Just the First Year for her Life Care, Lost Earnings, and Pain and Suffering.https://www.cbsnews.com/news/family-to-receive-15m-plus-in-first-ever-vaccine-autism-court-award/] [URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/family-to-receive-15m-plus-in-first-ever-vaccine-autism-court-award/]"

    "question": "Have we lost hope for the unification of quantum mechanics and gravity?",
    "answer": "We definitely have not lost hope finding the answer to this riddle but we also have put 100 percent faith in the “big bang theory” which has single handedly thwarted any attempt to answer any questions about the “macro” part of the equation. The problem is what we base our universe on. We have put all of our chips on gravity as being the sole creator of the universe. We are convinced that gravity alone can turn ordinary matter into the greatest objects known to man. It can't. It is impossible to realize how the history of our universe unfolded but so many questions about what we see now can be answered if we just would realize that gravity doesn't make heat but heat makes gravity. It is a “chicken or the egg” type situation. We think it was gas and dust turning into a star or black hole when really the matter started out superheated and was creating the gravity from the beginning. Our galaxy was one spinning, fusion filled mass. It flattened and cooled. After that, our stars were spinning, fusion filled masses. They flattened then cooled. Then our planets, again, fusion filled masses. They flattened and cooled creating the moon's and rings. So many questions answered. Why most everything rotates in nearly the same plane is answered. Why is everything so hot is answered. Why things we see billions of light years away are so bright are answered. Why stars start forming when the black hole seems to still have more to consume is answered. This theory is called the “centrifugal matter distribution process” and it does connect everything together with heat. Besides the bb theory, this is the only other way it all could have happened. All objects in space were created this way.\n"

    "question": "Can I use a dimmer with my LED?",
    "answer": "The short answer is generally yes. The longer answer follows.\n If you’re talking about dimming the actual LED chips, then you need to work back from that to the driver to a compatible dimmer.\n Assuming you’re talking about a complete fixture or lamp, then the answer is more complex.\n First, dimming. There are, broadly, three ways to dim an LED lamp or fixture.\nLine voltage. There are a range of technologies including resistance, triac, SCR, IGBT, that control the voltage, switching, or current to the end load. These technologies require no extra wiring to the device. Most dimmable lamps are intended to be dimmed with one of these types of dimmers.Low voltage. Generally 0–10V, this requires four wires to the devices—two for power and two for the low-voltage dimming.Digital. The most prevalent are DALI and DMX. There are also a host of proprietary protocols from various manufacturers.\nMost wallbox (standard household or commercial) wall dimmers are designed for line-voltage dimming and use either triacs or (less frequently) resistance to dim the load. These are inexpensive and very common dimmers—and so the majority of line-voltage dimmable LED fixtures are compatible with them.\n Fixture manufacturers will test and many publish lists of compatible dimmers for their fixtures.\n"

    "answer": "Atoms are now observable, with a Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope, as [LINKED_TEXT: Richard Muller] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Richard-Muller-3] showed in his answer. But atoms were known about long before that picture was, or could be, taken.\n While atoms were hypothesized as far back as Ancient Greece, the strongest evidence was chemistry. over several centuries of alchemy transforming into chemistry, it became obvious that all matter was made up of combinations of a relatively small number of elements, and that those elements combined in very precise proportions. Water was H20 - two parts Hydrogen to one part oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide, H2O2 existed, but was a different substance. But nothing like H2O(1.5) existed. The whole of chemistry could be explained by elements consisting of finite particles, which we call atoms, grouping up in fixed patterns. This model brought the flowering of Chemistry in the 19th century, even though no-one had ever seen an atom.\n The first direct evidence for atoms was when, in 1905, Einstein showed (in the paper which won him his Nobel prize) that Brownian motion could be precisely explained by the impact of atoms of water on floating seeds. The size and frequency of the movement of the visible seeds was exactly what would be predicted of water were made up of atoms.\n Not long after that, the Braggs invented X-Ray Crystallography, which showed that crystals diffracted X-Rays in exactly the way that they should if they consisted of atoms in a fixed arrangement. They could interpret the diffraction patterns to show the way the crystal,was assembled, thus \"seeing\" the atoms with the X-Rays. \n Since them, large numbers of devices have been build which would only work if atoms existed. But it was not until about 20 years ago, with STEM, that we were able to get such a direct image as that shown.\n"

    "answer": "Sridevi knew Rajini when he drank heavily and smoked a lot\n She knew Rajini when he yelled at spot boys and was belligerent to anyone but K Balachander and a handful of others\n She and Meena are the only two actresses who interacted with Rajinikanth in their teen & adult years (12–14) , Sujitha, Shalini are others but they never interacted with him as grown actresses\n Meena knew a different Rajini\n Sridevi saw a different Rajini\n She was frightened of him initially\n Yet Sridevi's mother was very trustful of Rajinikanth. She was close to him and Rajini protected Sridevi a lot when they acted together\n In those days Rajini shared his private phone number only with seven people apart from close family — Balachander, Kamal, SP Muthuraman, Raj Bahadur, Vishnuvardhan , Vijayakumar & Raji Amma who was Sridevi's mother\n Everyone else got his office phone where the Manager answered and connected the call to Rajinis home if necessary including MGR and MK\n That shows how close Sridevi was\n Nonetheless Rajinis relationship with Sridevi became strained a bit after she married Boney Kapoor\n Rajini didn't like that she broke a home and wasnt very pleased.\n This was when Sridevi began cultivating new friends and began to stop associating with her old friends like Kutti Padmini, Radhika, Radha and Jayasudha\n Nevertheless by 2009, they became professional friends again\n He invited her to Soundaryas first marriage\nShe fasted for him when he was ill in Singapore and delivered him some Prasad that sadly wasn't allowed by Singaporean Officials\n So on the whole except for a blip due to her Boney Kapoor marriage, Rajini and Sridevi were like Old Friends, Colleagues and a bit like Uncle and Niece since Raji Amma, Sridevi's mother was pretty close to Rajinikanth\n She was more professional than close with Kamal Hassan & Balachander\n The only other Kollywood Actor she interacted with regularly apart from Rajini was Poormina Bhagyaraj and later Ajith.\n"

    "question": "I have a fairly basic understanding of Python. But now I want to learn C++. Does this require me to learn C first?",
    "answer": "Not sure there IS a language that is easier to learn than Python. It’s a great first language, and it is ACTUALLY used in the real world, though in a different way than an enterprise-level, top-to-bottom, all purpose language like Java or C++. (Lookup how Data Analysts and AI researchers use Python over top of (to control) deeper C++ code libraries and tools.)\n If you already know C, then that and Python should be a good start for general programming, with Java and C++ as good followups. For web a development career track, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and PHP may be better followups than Java and C++.\n Now “learning” a language is VERY DIFFERENT than actually using a language all-day, every day, for 3 years. Just knowing the syntax and how to form basic logical structures and objects is generally enough to “learn” a language. Subtleties of language quirks, variable assignments, memory management, and compiler tricks are deeper knowledge you gain by researching and using a language over a long period of time. Honestly, that’s not something to do “just in case” or to have that language “in your back pocket” ready for a hypothetical future employer. The reason to have that level of knowledge is because you ARE using the language and you WILL be using it in the future.\n That said, EXPERIMENT! Try making fun projects in the various languages you are learning. If there’s a language you already KNOW you will be using in your career, get started using it to make a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game. Or make a utility to sort and name pictures and internet saves in your collection. Scrape headlines off your favorite news website. By doing these things, and rewriting them again in other programming languages, you’ll get a good feel for how languages are similar and how they differ. But nothing replaces career-oriented institutional industrial-strength full-time work for really understanding a language inside and out.\n"

    "question": "Which are the best CCTV cameras for a 2 floor bungalow? What are the things to remember before buying a CCTV camera for the whole home?",
    "answer": "When choosing CCTV cameras for a two-floor bungalow or the entire home, there are several factors to consider. Here are some things to remember before making a purchase:\n 1. Coverage Area: Assess the areas you want to cover with CCTV cameras. Determine the number of indoor and outdoor locations that require surveillance. Consider entry points, windows, driveways, and any vulnerable areas that need monitoring.\n 2. Camera Types: Select the appropriate camera types based on your needs. Dome cameras are discreet and suitable for indoor use, while bullet cameras are better suited for outdoor surveillance due to their weather-resistant design. Pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras offer flexibility in adjusting the viewing angle.\n 3. Resolution and Image Quality: Higher resolution cameras provide clearer and more detailed images. For reliable identification of people and objects, consider cameras with at least 1080p Full HD resolution. If you require even greater detail, consider cameras with 4K resolution.\n 4. Night Vision Capability: Ensure that the CCTV cameras have good low-light performance or built-in infrared (IR) LEDs for night vision. This is essential for capturing clear footage in low-light conditions or complete darkness.\n 5. Storage Options: Determine how you want to store the recorded footage. Some cameras have built-in memory or support local storage options like SD cards, while others use network video recorders (NVRs) or cloud storage. Evaluate the storage capacity and choose an option that suits your needs.\n 6. Connectivity and Remote Viewing: Check if the cameras support Wi-Fi or wired connections. Wi-Fi connectivity offers flexibility during installation, while wired connections provide a more stable and reliable connection. Additionally, consider cameras that allow remote viewing via mobile apps or web browsers, enabling you to monitor your home from anywhere.\n 7. Motion Detection and Alerts: Look for cameras with motion detection capabilities that can send notifications or trigger recording when motion is detected. This helps reduce the amount of recorded footage and alerts you to potential security events.\n 8. Integration with Home Security Systems: If you have an existing home security system or plan to install one, ensure that the CCTV cameras can integrate with it. This allows for a more comprehensive security solution with centralized control and monitoring.\n 9. Brand Reputation and Reviews: Research reputable brands known for producing high-quality CCTV cameras. Read customer reviews and ratings to gauge the performance and reliability of the cameras you are considering.\n 10. Budget Considerations: Set a budget for your CCTV camera system and consider the cost of cameras, additional equipment (such as NVRs or cables), installation, and ongoing maintenance.\n"

    "question": "How was the manorial system a consequence of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire?",
    "answer": "The centralize state was failing during the late empire; the central government did not have the competence or means to regulate the daily lives of the population. However, by then, productive land was concentrated in the hands of a few. It made sense to let those few powerful landowners served as their own local government and then control them.\n When the invaders took over, it was a very easy model to follow. All the invader had to do was knock off the landowner and replace him with your own man. Those bonded to the landed did as they did before but the person they served changed. For those, the faces changed but the game remained the same.\n So, when the “empire collapse,” the vast majority of the population did not know or care since they had long since been distant from any real decision making or independent law. They served the lord of the area, he was the law and they served him.\n Manorialism is a very easy model of local control. The barbarians readily picked it up. They were the warrior, legal, taxation authority, etc.\n The only issue was how much taxes the landowner paid to the guy at the very top and when he had to fight for that person.\n"

    "question": "How do I know when to save as JPEG or PNG?",
    "answer": "Use the JPEG file format when you want to convert a photo image for digital storage and reference. Archive the original image because the JPEG image will never be as good as the source image.\n Use PNG for sending and displaying composite graphic images or illustrations over the internet.\nJPEG is a file format developed by photographic experts for the digital storage and display of photographic images. It is a lossy compression format that takes advantage of the limitations of human perception to throw away image data bits that you normally wouldn't miss. When converting an image, the amount of compression can be chosen by the user with greater compression producing smaller files but at a cost of lower resolution, grainier image quality. The JPEG format does NOT support transparency; there are no transparent areas in a photograph.\n PNG is a file format developed for the transport of graphics over networks, hence the name Portable Network Graphics (PNG). It is a raster-graphics file format that supports lossless data compression. PNG supports transparency, grayscale, and all combinations of RGB images. It does NOT support CMYK based images used in professional printing environments.\n"

    "question": "What are some common mistakes foreigners make when ordering in a French restaurant?",
    "answer": "In France, the menu is always posted outside the restaurant, so you can have a good idea of what they serve and the prices before you go in.When ordering at a French restaurant, you order the starter and main course only. When you have finished your main course, the waiter will come back to take your order for the cheese course, then dessert and finally coffee in that sequence.If you want a medium steak, you must ask for it « Bien cuit » otherwise it will arrive dripping in blood. Be warned!Don't order the steak carpaccio unless you've got good teeth. These are thin slices of raw beef which are as tough as shoe-leather.If you see cuisses de grenouilles (frogs' legs) on the menu, don't order them. The French don't eat them in spite of what you've been told, so they will have been in the bottom of the freezer for three years and will have probably thawed out and re-frozen several times and will have completely lost their flavour and texture.A French waiter asks what you would like to drink, but doesn't ask you if you'd like another drink when the main course arrives. So as soon as the starters arrive, make sure that you order more drinks before they disappear into the kitchen for an hour.In France, you are expected to keep your cutlery for the second course.French waiters don't understand that putting your knife and fork together on the plate in the half-past-six position means that you want it cleared. The French don't know that, so they will ask « Terminé ? » irrespective of the position of your knife and fork although it would be obvious to anyone else.Don't forget to leave a good tip even if the menu says « Service compris ». €2 per person on your table would be the absolute minimum.\n"

    "question": "What is it like being a farmer? Are farmers happy?",
    "answer": "Farmers often live in rural areas and can be isolated; for many, although they may have wealth tied up in stock or crops or land, it isn’t necessarily a lucrative business. Often farmers have large mortgages and low incomes.\n The weather has always been a major variable outside the farmer’s control, but now climate change is making extreme weather events more frequent & more intense. Many famers have to deal with such inclement weather that it detrimentally affects their psyche and their conditions of work and their livestock or crop production. If production suffers as a result, then the farmer is unable to make enough sales to adequately provide for himself and his family.\n This increases overall financial stress, and leaves the farmer with less money to reinvest in the business - with less money to reinvest, systems become more strained, shortcuts get taken and the potential crop for the following year may remain lower than average. Not only is being a famer considered to be among the lowest paying jobs in the United States, but it requires long hours and significant hard work.\n Outside of other family members, being a farmer often results in minimal social interaction, which may contribute to stress and depression. Perhaps most notably, farmers are often exposed to pesticides, which have been linked to suicide. For these reasons, suicide rates among farmers are approximately 1.32 times that of your average occupation.\n"

    "question": "Just to feel the concept and to make that more practical, can we define 'potential difference' as 'charge difference (difference in amount of charges)'?",
    "answer": "No, because potential difference is part of e-fields, and e-fields (such as in radio waves) aren’t being kept in existence by any charges. “Volts-per-meter” doesn’t mention charges. Pure voltage alone, far from any charges …that’s known as an electrostatic field or e-field.\n So, with EM waves, or even with AC changing e-fields, the value of charges can be zero, yet we can still have a large potential difference.\n Or how about a far less weird reason: two cables which have the same charge-difference can have VASTLY different potential-difference, since potential difference is not charge difference. It depends on the capacitance of the two cables.\n Also, two capacitors can each have the same charge-difference on their plates, yet have potential difference that’s off by 100 times, or maybe by 10,000 times, or sometimes a billion times higher than that (compare a 0.1pf capacitor to a 1000farad supercapacitor, each with the same plate-charge. Their voltage differs by 10^16X, a thousand-billion volts …times ten thousand! But the charge-difference on each capacitor is exactly the same.)\n See, volts are not coulombs.

Everybofy knows MAC adresses because its the most common used by computers. But its limited to 100 meters.\n Your Internet provider needs to cover many kilometers. Ethernet can’t be used outside to connect homes to central office. They can use copper twisted pairs DSL, coax Docsys, Optical fiber, wimax, Cellular radio, etc… these uses different format of interface addresses. Ethernet MAC changes from network segment to the next.\n The IP addresse remain the same accros the Internet as packets travel from Technology to rhe next.\n In your house, besides Ethernet, you are probably using Wifi.

    "answer": "The real issue regarding this question is why physicists are concerned about what a person perceives. Are we discussing physics or perception?\n Acceleration is not gravity. Acceleration is a behavior of physical matter; gravity is always present whether or not the physical matter is present, as gravity is a property of space.\n The “thought experiment” of being in a box and not being able to discern the difference between acceleration and gravity is not physics. It is imagination. There is no physical world significance in knowing a person’s perception when working in physics.\n This is not to say that our perceptions cannot be quantified, as we clearly see that our perceptions can be quantified, such as with optics and the Doppler effect. But just because we can change our perception of a distant galaxy and make it appear closer to us does not make the galaxy physically closer. And neither does the movement of an observer relative to the medium change the speed of waves or frequency in the medium.\n When we allow our perceptions to taint our understanding of physical reality, we begin to see things that do not physically exist. There is no equivalence of gravity and acceleration just because a human cannot discriminate between them while enclosed in a box.\n"

    "question": "Can we use agar instead of agarose in Gel electrophoresis?",
    "answer": "Yes and no. If you are hoping to get the same performance, resolution, and band sharpness from agar as you do from agarose you will be disappointed. This is because agarose is purified to be free from (or low in) charged molecules that can interfere with band migration. Also, if you are trying to use DNA fragments isolated from gels in cloning then the impurities in agar may inhibit the enzymes used.\n However, if you are looking for a low-cost alternative to agarose for a teaching lab then it may be ok to use agar as a demonstration of electrophoresis. See the article below on setting up a low-cost demonstration lab using materials that can be found in stores such a grocery or hardware stores and pet supply stores. They use agar, a hand-made gel box made from a plastic tray and aluminum foil, fish tank buffers, and a power supply made from five 9-volt batteries hooked up in series:\n [LINKED_TEXT: Inexpensive and safe DNA gel electrophoresis using household materials] [URL: https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bmb.20596]\nHorizontal submerged DNA gels are typically made of agarose, a purified form of agar composed of only neutral carbohydrate chains. One concern with using agar, rather than agarose, for gel electrophoresis is that charged carbohydrates in agar could cause bands to become diffuse due to electro‐osmosis [[LINKED_TEXT: 13] [URL: https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bmb.20596#bib13], [LINKED_TEXT: 14] [URL: https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bmb.20596#bib14]].

While Now brand agar (Now Foods, Bloomingdale, IL) or BactoAgar (Difco) are suitable, Telephone brand agar‐agar (Sirian International, Bangkok, Thailand) performed best.

That’s because once here an undocumented, the last thing they want to do is to bring attention to themselves which would result in deportation. Mostly they work at low wage jobs, where they can’t complain lest they draw attention to themselves and get deported, and pay taxes because should immigration laws change, they want to show that they’ve been paying their dues, as it were.

    "question": "Who is Samuel Beckett?",
    "answer": "“Theorizing that one could time travel within his own lifetime, Dr. Samuel Beckett led an elite group of scientists into the desert for a project called “Quantum Leap.” Pressured by the government to demonstrate results or lose funding, Dr. Beckett stepped into the Quantum Leap accelarator- and vanished.\n “He awoke to find himself trapped in the past, facing mirror images that were not his own, and driven by an unknown force to change history for the better. His only guide on this journey is Al, the projector observer, who appears in the form of a hologram that only Dr. Beckett can see and hear. And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself trapped in the past, leaping from life to life, striving to put right what once went wrong, and hoping each time that his next leap… will be the leap home…” {an imperfect quotation from nearly thirty year old memories}\n Unless you meant the absurdist playright, author of “Waiting for Godot” and “Endgame.” If that is who you are asking about, then there are other far better answers to this question that have already been posted.\n"

    "question": "Why are so many tech companies eyeing the financial industry?",
    "answer": "The major tech companies, including Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Alibaba and Tencent make tremendous amounts of money by getting consumers on their ecosystem, keeping them engaged in that ecosystem, and monetizing their eyeballs and or transactions on that controlled ecosystem.\n They realize that offering payment services, checking accounts, ETFs, credit cards and other financial services is beneficial for them for four reasons.\nIt keeps consumers actively engaged in their ecosystems for longer, and increases traditional “eyeball” Monetization.It is a lucrative source for additional data that can be monetized.It is a lucrative source for additional revenues.Lastly, it decreases friction for consumer transactions on the platform.\nAlibaba and Tencent have pioneered this with Ant Financial/AliPay and WeChat Pay respectively.\n Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google are working to catch up.\n All of them are careful about Regulators, and two of them (Facebook and Google) are also battling significant “trust deficits”. However, they are correctly betting that consumers value convenience more than privacy. Where they will really struggle is in the EU (regulation), and the rest of the world, where Alibaba and Tencent will be formidable competitors.\n Thank you for the a2a.\n"

    "question": "Why has indexed shifting displaced traditional friction shifting on bicycles?",
    "answer": "Because indexed shifting feels better to the average bike rider, and people are happy to pay more for a premium-feeling product.\n You move the lever, the gears shift smoothly by one sprocket. There is no “guess a distance to move the shift lever then trim the lever to reduce drivetrain grinding/clicking”.\n Indexed shifting has also given rise to STI integrated brake / gear shift levers on road bikes, and Rapid Fire shift levers on mountain bikes, which aren’t really possible with friction shifters.\n The only real advantages of friction shifters are\nAble to shift many gears fast if you hit a steep hill. Not really a problem as people can shift “fast enough” with indexed shifters, especially if you look ahead at the terrain. Some indexed shifters are able to shift multiple gears at a time, and electronic DI2 shifters can be set to shift continuously as long as you hold the lever down.No requirement to tune-up shifters when indexing drifts out of alignment. Quality shifters don’t need tuning often, and bike shops are more than happy to sell you indexed shifters then make money off regular servicing.Lower purchase cost. Only really applies at the bottom end of the market. People seem to be prepared to pay for indexed shifters.More reliable when riding in remote areas where modern parts and servicing may not be available.\n"

    "question": "How do I clean a faux rabbit fur area rug?",
    "answer": "Faux rabbit fur area rugs can add a cozy and luxurious feel to your home décor, but they can also collect dirt, dust, and other debris over time. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you clean your faux rabbit fur area rug:\nShake out the rug: Take the rug outside and gently shake it to remove any loose dirt, dust, or debris.Vacuum the rug: Use a handheld vacuum or a vacuum with a brush attachment to gently vacuum the rug, starting from one end and working your way to the other. Be sure to use a gentle suction and avoid applying too much pressure, which can damage the fibers.Spot-clean stains: If there are any stains or spills on the rug, spot-clean them using a solution of warm water and mild detergent. Gently blot the stain with a clean, damp cloth until it is removed.Wash the rug: Fill a large sink or bathtub with cool water and add a small amount of mild detergent. Submerge the rug in the water and gently agitate it with your hands. Avoid using a brush or scrubbing the rug, as this can damage the fibers.Rinse the rug: Once the rug has been washed, drain the water and rinse the rug thoroughly with cool water until all of the soap has been removed.Dry the rug: Hang the rug outside or lay it flat on a clean, dry surface to air-dry. Avoid exposing the rug to direct sunlight or heat sources, as this can cause the fibers to shrink or melt.Fluff the rug: Once the rug is dry, use a soft-bristled brush to fluff the fibers and restore its texture.\nIt's important to note that faux rabbit fur rugs can be delicate and may require special care, so always check the care label on your rug for specific cleaning instructions or consult a professional cleaner if you're unsure about the best way to clean your rug.\n"

    "question": "Is the greatest design classic the Fender Stratocaster?",
    "answer": "It would be hard to find an example of guitar design that has had a greater impact than the Stratocaster. There are many enduring guitar designs, but none that are still as popular and useful. Its funny too, because there have been many improvements and variants of the design, yet the most popular ones that are those closest to the original model. What really pushes the Strat over the top is its versatility. It is ergonomically comfortable, relatively inexpensive even for good quality models, it can be used for just about any genre requiring an electric guitar. They are also very reliable. If they had any drawback it was that the single coil picks had a lot of noisy hum at high volumes. The humbucking pickups in Gibson guitars have allowed Gibson to give the Strat a run for its money, but many people are willing to put up with the “hum” to get the unique tones that only a Strat can provide. Fender has since been able to capture the same tone in a noiseless pick up, so what more can you ask for?\n"

    "question": "How can we ensure that pulp industries pay a fair price to mango farmers?",
    "answer": "Ensuring that pulp industries pay a fair price to mango farmers involves addressing various factors and implementing effective mechanisms. Here are some considerations:\n 1. Transparent pricing mechanisms: Implement transparent pricing mechanisms that ensure fairness in determining the price of mangoes. This can include establishing market-based pricing systems, creating platforms for price discovery, and promoting open and competitive bidding processes.\n 2. Contract farming and written agreements: Encourage the use of written contracts between mango farmers and pulp industries. These contracts should clearly define the terms and conditions, including the quantity, quality requirements, pricing, payment terms, and dispute resolution mechanisms. Contract farming provides a structured framework that helps protect farmers' interests and ensures fair dealings.\n 3. Farmer organizations and cooperatives: Strengthen farmer organizations and cooperatives to collectively negotiate prices with pulp industries. Farmer collectives can enhance the bargaining power of mango farmers and enable them to secure better prices through collective marketing and negotiations.\n 4. Market information and capacity building: Provide mango farmers with access to market information, including price trends, demand forecasts, and processing industry requirements. This information empowers farmers to make informed decisions and negotiate fair prices. Capacity-building programs can also enhance farmers' understanding of market dynamics and improve their negotiation skills.\n 5. Government regulations and interventions: Governments can play a crucial role in ensuring fair pricing for mango farmers by enacting policies and regulations that protect their interests. This can include setting minimum support prices, regulating pulp industries to prevent unfair practices, and providing subsidies or incentives to support mango cultivation.\n 6. Quality standards and certification: Encourage mango farmers to adopt good agricultural practices and obtain quality certifications. Implementing quality standards helps ensure that farmers receive fair prices for their high-quality produce. Certifications such as organic or fair trade can provide additional value and differentiation, attracting buyers willing to pay premium prices.\n 7. Collaboration and dialogue: Facilitate dialogue and collaboration between mango farmers, pulp industries, and relevant stakeholders. Engaging in open discussions and partnerships can help foster mutually beneficial relationships, address concerns, and find solutions that promote fair pricing practices.\n It is important to recognize that ensuring fair prices to mango farmers requires collective efforts from farmers, industry stakeholders, government bodies, and consumer awareness. Building transparent and equitable supply chains is essential for creating a fair and sustainable market for mango farmers.\n"

    "question": "Why was the Nelson class battleship's C turret lower than the B turret in front? Wouldn't a higher C turret allow all guns to fire forwards?",
    "answer": "A ship with three sequential superfiring turrets is indeed possible and was implemented on the British Dido-class and US Atlanta-class cruisers.\nDido-class\nAtlanta-class\n The disadvantage of this arrangement is a higher centre of mass which decreases stability, especially in heavy seas.\n The Didos and Atlantas carried a 5.25” and 5” main armament respectively. These relatively light guns and light turret armour reduced the weight penalty of the superfiring turrets to within acceptable limits.\n The Nelson-class carried 16” guns (108 tons each as opposed to around 4.5 tons for the 5.25”) and the turrets and mounts were proportionately more heavily armoured. Three superfiring turrets were totally impractical.\n The Nelson-class were designed with three turrets forwards in an attempt to minimise the space (and weight) required by the armoured citadel in order to meet the constraints of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922.\nNelson-class\n The result was the curious staggered arrangement seen above. Although this limited the Nelson-class to firing only six guns directly forward, it should be borne in mind firstly, that most previous battleships could only fire four guns directly forward and secondly, that at the time of the design it was still anticipated that battleships would fight in line of battle and thus be firing broadside rather than straight ahead.\n In light of these factors, the design compromise made for this class was not really a significant disadvantage.\n"

    "answer": "In spite of Buffett famously calling derivatives “weapons of mass destruction,” yes, he uses them.\n To take one easy example from Berkshire’s 2018 10K (annual report):\nDerivative contracts may require significant cash settlement payments and result in significant losses in the future.\n Over ten years ago, we assumed the risk of potentially significant losses under a number of equity index put option contracts. The contracts remaining at year end 2018 will expire from 2019 through 2025. Risks of losses under these contracts are based on declines in equity prices of stocks comprising certain major US and international stock indexes. We received considerable cash premiums as compensation for accepting these risks. Absent major reductions in future equity securities prices, our ultimate payment obligations are not likely to be significant. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that equity securities prices will not decline significantly resulting in settlement payments that significantly exceed the year end 2018 intrinsic value of the contracts ($1.7 billion), recorded fair value ($2.45 billion) or the premiums we received at inception ($4.0 billion.)\nThis quote is sourced from page K-24 of the following link: [LINKED_TEXT: http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2018ar/201810-k.pdf] [URL: http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2018ar/201810-k.pdf].

    "answer": "Interesting question, but frankly, those that are probably the most dysfunctional are the least well known, simply because they didn’t last long enough to be recognized. The dichotomy that develops in long-standing popular bands occurs over periods of time, much like in marriages or business relationships. The Beatles, Pink Floyd, CSNY, Fleetwood Mac & all those many & other successful popular artists worked through ups, downs, in-betweens & enormous success before matters came to the public forefront; thrusting them into the spotlight of “dysfunctionality” … much to the dismay of their fans & the joy of the tabloids or Internet! Some survive perpetually these days by remaining distant between infrequent engagements (Rolling Stones, The Who, Grateful Dead remnants, etc) but the toll of maintaining a lasting, cohesive relationship among creative egotistical parts-of-the-sum is a ongoing struggle. In short, it’s a lot of work & those that don’t expose overt dysfunction are either lucky or good at hiding it.\n"

    "question": "What piece of evidence do we have that reproduction of humans on Earth started with two people?",
    "answer": "The scientific evidence that all human beings may have descended from one pair of human beings (or rather from one mother), is the discovery of the gene called Cytochrome Oxidase 1 ([math]CO_1[/math])\n[LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #lqbwO], which is so similar in all human beings that it strongly indicates a common origin for all human beings. If human beings have had diverse and multiple chains of ancestors, there would have been noticeable difference between the [math]CO_1[/math] genes in human beings. In fact the same is the case with many other species in existence today. The rational evidence regarding origin of all humans beings from a single pair of man and woman is evident from the fact that we all have spiritual instinct (seeking some ideal), we all have a sense of morality and we all have rational method of thinking. No other species in the world has these abilities. Thus humans are a unique species like no other species in the world. It means that humans have been specifically created in this form, rather than an entire population of humans evolving “randomly” from an entire population of prehuman apes, and somehow all of them ending up having these exalted characteristics.\n The ultimate evidence that human beings have been created from a single pair of man and woman is what has been mentioned in the Quran:\n “O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allāh is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allāh is Knowing and Aware.” (Al-Quran 49:13)\n Our scientific knowledge may some day reach the level that we may be able to establish the same fact through scientific method, or we may never reach such level of knowledge, however what has been revealed by Allah is the ultimate truth.\nFootnotes\n[LINKED_TEXT: [1] ] [URL: #cite-lqbwO][LINKED_TEXT: Why should mitochondria define species?] [URL: https://pontecorbolipress.com/journals/index.php/he/article/view/HE2018121037]"

    "question": "Which is the easiest metal to machine between aluminium, magnesium, and copper (brass/bronze)?",
    "answer": "Aluminum- good to excellent machinability. Capable of very high speed machining due to it's high heat conductivity removing frictional heat from the cutting zone. Typical machining issue is development of a build-up on the edge of the cutting tool, this can lead to tool breakage. Chip evacuation can be a problem in drills and narrow slots.Magnesium. Machinability similar to aluminium, however suffers from the issue that the swarf is flammable, very fine chips and shavings may be highly flammable if dry. Once ignited, a magnesium fire is extremely difficult to extinguish and water based fire extinguishers should never be used on magnesium. Water based flood coolant is mandatory. Mg is easy to machine from a theoretical standpoint but challenging to machine from the standpoint of fire safety.Copper- good machinability, however commercially pure copper may produce long, stringy, gummy chips. Higher strength low alloy copper such as Cu-Be or Cu-Cr alloys tend to have better machinability.Brass. Excellent machinability. Machinability rating of 100%, serves as a standard to which other materials are compared in their machinability.Bronze- depends on the alloy. Machinability generally good. Excellent with leaded bronzes…if you don't care about the hazardous waste considerations. High nickel bronzes may posess high work hardening tendency leading to tool chatter and surface glazing issues.\n"

    "question": "If Kim Jong-un is dead, then why aren't they declaring it in the open?",
    "answer": "Back in 1975 there was a brand new comedy show called NBC’s Saturday Night.\n One of the regular segments featured this fellow who would read satirical news stories\nAnd one of the bits that was an immediate hit was his riff on this fellow\nFrancisco Franco, the dictator of Spain.\n A typical segment would be “This just in! Generalísimo Francisco Franco of Spain is still dead. More to come.”\n Franco’s death, like Stalin’s death 20 years earlier, put his immediate allies into turmoil. Technically, Franco had a clear successor, Prince Juan Carlos, the son of the previous King of Spain. However, Franco had been in charge for 40 years at this point and despite the fact Franco had trusted Juan Carlos, things were not as they seemed.\n You see, Juan Carlos had double crossed Franco. While outwardly supporting Franco and his policies, he had secretly been meeting with oppositon leaders to arrange a peaceful transition back to democracy. When rumours (that were totally true) of Franco’s death started to leak out, the people who had been loyal to him suddenly saw themselves as looking down the barrel of return to the rule of law.\n Franco’s loyalists still controlled the military, but staging a military coup of the new King at the moment of Franco’s death was not really a viable option. After all, you can’t stage a coup when the King hasn’t even taken charge yet.\n So, in a blatant attempt to keep their authority when it was crumbling around them, Franco’s loyalists claimed that Franco was just fine thank you very much and that they still held their own offices.\n However, eventually the truth won out. Juan Carlos finally took control of the government and pushed the Franco loyalists aside, replacing them with hand picked reformers.\n Now, it appears that rumours of Kim Jong Un’s death are much exaggerated at this point. South Korean intelligence is already on record as saying that they would expect to see certain things happen if Kim had died which haven’t happened. However, if Kim did die and it wasn’t clear who should succeed him, the military and civilian leaders who feared for their jobs would probably try to keep it under wraps as long as possible.\n"

    "question": "Learning programming: When is it appropriate to use UDP instead of TCP?",
    "answer": "When correctness and completeness are not that important, or when “moving forward” is more important. (TCP requires that the sender and receiver synchronize their records. UDP doesn’t, at the cost of possible data loss.)\n This is useful for streaming data, non-critical telemetry (where data is resent all the time), and for simple protocols implemented in embedded devices with little memory and no time to lose.\n Note that you need to be careful with UDP behavior and must treat the system in the way that data can be lost anytime. Some control systems are too unsafe to be used with UDP unless serious considerations are taken.\n For example, if you’re running a wireless-controlled Mars rover with TCP in a low-latency network, you can use simple GO and STOP commands to control the vehicle movement. However, if you do the same in a high-latency network or using UDP, what would happen if GO command registers, but not STOP? Your rover goes off the cliff or runs over colonists! For UDP implementation, you need something like “FORWARD 5m” commands instead.\n It’s also why “just use UDP” is not the answer. You need to consider both the needs and constraints carefully.\n"

    "question": "What would happen if we detonated a nuclear bomb on the Moon or Jupiter?",
    "answer": "The universe is radioactive.\n Cosmic rays, solar radiation, carbon/potassium/uranium/thorium/radium/… decaying.\n Any planet/moon without a magnetosphere / ozone layer gets a LOT of radiation.\n A nuclear weapon produces a lot of extra radiation for a few years, after that its measurable, but not substantially more dangerous than radiation that already is hitting that area.\n Cosmic rays are particularly dangerous on the moon/mars. High energy protons/betas, that have both penetrating capability and the power to do damage (the worst of gamma radiation combined with the worst of alpha radiation). On earth cosmic rays decay to muons, loosing a lot of their energy. Our bodies can handle muons just fine (otherwise we’d get cancer just from being outside at night frequently).\n Anyhow that assumes cancers are caused by single DNA damage to a single cell, which is proven to be false. Living things have radiation repair mechanisms. It takes repeated punishment and a failure in such mechanisms for cancer to occur.\n Nuclear weapons are dangerous to living things. For planets / moons devoid of life, they might leave a crater, or transform dust into glass. That’s all. Jupiter is a gas giant, if a nuke is thrown at the Jovian atmosphere if its not set to detonate at ultra high altitudes, the massive pressure buildup will likely destroy the ignition circuits and deform the core so it will fizzle/fail to detonate. The massive atmosphere and strong wings will dilute the radiation and in a few hours the radiation will be hard to measure.\n The Venus atmosphere would also corrode and try to crush the nuclear weapon as well. Likely would fizzle / fail to detonate.\n"

    "question": "With how hard it is being an undocumented immigrant, why not just give them citizenship?",
    "answer": "The issue of undocumented immigration is complex and controversial, and there are a variety of opinions on how best to address it. While some argue for granting citizenship to undocumented immigrants, others believe that doing so would encourage more illegal immigration and would be unfair to those who have gone through the legal process to obtain citizenship.\n There are several reasons why it can be difficult for undocumented immigrants to obtain legal status. In some cases, they may have entered the country illegally or overstayed their visas, which can make it difficult or impossible to obtain legal status. Additionally, the process of obtaining legal status can be time-consuming, expensive, and complicated, and there may be limited options available for certain individuals or groups.\n However, granting citizenship to undocumented immigrants is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of a variety of factors, including the economic impact on the country, the impact on existing citizens and legal residents, and the legal and ethical implications of such a policy. It's also worth noting that any policy changes related to undocumented immigration would need to be made through the legislative process, which can be slow and contentious.\n Ultimately, the question of whether or not to grant citizenship to undocumented immigrants is a matter of political debate, and different people and groups will have different opinions on the matter. It's important to approach this issue with compassion and empathy for all those affected, and to work towards finding solutions that are fair, just, and compassionate.\n"

    "question": "How did pirate captains earn the respect of their crew?",
    "answer": "It’s hard to generalize since even the so-called “Golden Age” of Atlantic-Caribbean piracy lasted over a century and there was no one single way pirate crews were organized and run. But broadly speaking, a pirate who didn’t have the respect of the crew would never become captain in the first place.\n Piracy was an almost inevitable death sentence if captured. It was only worth the risk for a sailor through the promise of making a lot of money, and an escape from the terrible living conditions and barbaric discipline found on most merchant and Navy vessels in the 17th century. Captains and other officers were therefore expected to hold up their end of the bargain.\n The vast majority of crews were organized as criminal co-ops, usually with commonly agreed upon compacts. The captain might be elected and replaced by crew vote, or simply be deposed if he (there were historically female captains but they were a very small number) proved despotic, incompetent, or just unlucky. By whatever mechanism, the captain only maintained his position with the consent of the crew.\n"

    "question": "What is the bond angle of PCl3?",
    "answer": "Bond angle of PCl3 is Less than 109 degree. Phosphorus trichloride is a rare compound with the chemical formula PCl3. Pure liquid, a pure chemical, is an important industrial chemical, used in the production of phosphites and other organophosphorus compounds. It is toxic and reacts violently with water to release hydrogen chloride. Phosphorus trichloride is a precursor to organophosphorus compounds that contain one or more P (III) atoms, mainly phosphites and phosphonates. These compounds do not usually contain the chlorine atoms found in PCl3. PCl3 reacts violently with water to form phosphorus acid, H3PO3 and HCl. A large number of similar reaction reactions are known, most importantly the formation of phosphites by reaction with alcohol or phenols. For example, with phenol, triphenyl phosphite is formed. PCl3 is indirectly important as PCl5's precursor, POCl3 and PSCl3, used in many applications, including herbicides, insecticides, plasticisers, oil additives, and flame retardants.\n"

Certainly it is a threat in a way that individuals counting cards is generally not.\n Is there a way that individuals counting cards can be a threat to Casino profitability? Yes there can, one only has to look at the effects that Mr. Don Johnson had in the Golden Nugget, Atlantic City. But part (perhaps the majority) of Mr. Johnson’s genius lay in the concessions that negotiated with Nugget Management/Marketing. Without that base he would have found it much more difficult to win so much money as an individual, even one who bet “so large”.\n But these are the exceptions. In an exceptional game.\n Typically mathematicians can’t have an effect on Craps, or on Baccarat (side bets to one side), or Slot machines, or most EGM’s.\n Roulette can be vulnerable if the wheel itself has a mechanical bias. This can be uncovered by recording numbers and employing very basic statistics.\n It can also be vulnerable to “wheel clocking”, typically with a device, which takes some math skills to program but really only good reactions to deploy. Also it appears that some people really can, intuitively, “wheel clock” themselves with uncanny degrees of accuracy.\n But frankly they can all be defeated by calling NMB earlier.\n So Vegas cannot be “completely destroyed by mathematicians” because it is far less vulnerable to them than might be popularly thought.\n"

    "answer": "There are[LINKED_TEXT:  four common classifications of lasers] [URL: https://www.acctekgroup.com/fiber-laser-cutting-machine/], namely, by gain medium, output power, working mode and pulse width.\nAccording to the gain medium: The gain medium of the laser includes gas, liquid and solid, and the specific gain medium determines the laser wavelength, output power and application field. Gas lasers are representative of CO2 gas lasers, and solids are representative of ruby ​​lasers, semiconductor lasers, fiber lasers, and YAG lasers; liquid lasers use certain liquids (usually organic solvents, such as dyes) as lasers. The work is pragmatic and emits a laser.\n According to the output power: usually, it can be divided into low power (below 1000W), medium power (1000-3000W), high power (above 3000W); but the power segments defined by different manufacturers are also different, and there is no uniformity in the industry. specification. Different power lasers are suitable for different application scenarios.\n According to the working mode: it can be divided into continuous laser and pulsed laser. The CW laser can output continuously for a long period of time, with stable operation and high thermal effect. Pulsed lasers output in the form of pulses, the main features are high peak power and small thermal effect; according to the length of the pulse, pulsed lasers can be further divided into milliseconds, microseconds, nanoseconds, picoseconds and femtoseconds. Generally speaking, the shorter the pulse time, , the higher the single pulse energy, the narrower the pulse width and the higher the machining accuracy.\n According to the output wavelength: it can be divided into infrared laser, visible light laser, ultraviolet laser, etc. Substances with different structures can absorb light in different wavelength ranges. For example, metals have a higher absorption rate for near-infrared light, and non-metals have better absorption for the wavelength (10.6um) emitted by CO2 lasers.\n"

And “fold” to reach this case means “perfect cut” (otherwise folding implies losses and tensions with paper bending - see last picture).\n Here’s a visual Excel quickie to better visualise distances, with kms, light years and parsecs at each fold (ignoring Excel’s lack of precision on huge scales).\n But, just for fun, ignoring laws of physics, an A4 paper, “folded”:\n~43 times - you’ve passed the Moon~52 times - you’ve passed the Sun~58 times - you get around the atom size with your cut pieces~70 times - you’ve reached Alpha Centauri~104 times - the huge line of fragmented elementary particles stretches longer than the diameter of the observable universe.\nEnjoy!\nEdit: Updated the above sheet on the good observation of Ben Sheard.

    "question": "My family wants to put my cat down. She started being sick a couple of weeks ago by throwing up and peeing everywhere. I don’t want to put her down. Will the veterinarian let me put my cat down even if she is not sick?",
    "answer": "Try to find shelters in your area who do low cost check ups to see if anything is wrong with the cat. There is no reason to put a healthy cat to sleep so finding out if something is wrong with them is of the essence. If the kitty is sick, you can try to ask the vet if they know the cost treatments that might suit your parent's budget. There are circumstances in which a cat might be too sick for treatment (like end stage kidney failure) but all those things can only be determined by a proper medical exam.\n You posted that you are a teen, perhaps you can talk to your parents and ask them if they want to put the cat down if its healthy and if so why? If they simply cannot afford to keep the cat, try to find a foster organization or shelter. Many people look for wonderful pets to home daily. If money is an issue perhaps letting your cat go to a foster home or shelter might give them a better chance to be healthy and happy.\n When we are teenagers a lot of things are out of our control, however- what you could control, is to make sure that your cat has the best possible option where they are happy and cared for. One of the things with becoming an adult is facing responsability and making choices, in this case you have the choice to speak up for them since they cannot speak for themselves.\n Another word to you, if you cannot keep this oet for financial reasons please do not adopt until you are an adult and can take care of a pet's bills just so this doesn't have to affect both your cat and you again.\n"

    "question": "Can I let my pet rat go into the wild?",
    "answer": "No, it is not safe or ethical to release a pet rat into the wild. Domesticated rats have been bred for generations to be dependent on human care and are not adapted to survive in the wild. Releasing a pet rat into the wild can cause harm to both the rat and the local ecosystem.\n Pet rats are not equipped to find their own food, water, or shelter, and they may struggle to compete with wild rats for resources. They may also be more susceptible to predators and diseases in the wild.\n Furthermore, pet rats are not native to most areas and can become an invasive species if released into the wild. Invasive species can cause harm to the local ecosystem by competing with native species for resources, disrupting food webs, and spreading diseases.\n If you are no longer able to care for your pet rat, it is important to find a responsible and knowledgeable individual or organization to take over its care. You can try contacting local animal shelters, rescue organizations, or breed-specific clubs to find a suitable home for your pet rat.\n"

    "question": "If Java is not good for 3D games, then why is Minecraft still using Java and not recreated in C++?",
    "answer": "While it's true that Java may not be the optimal choice for building 3D games, Minecraft is still written in Java for a few reasons:\n 1. Cross-platform compatibility: Java is a cross-platform language, which means that the same code can run on different operating systems without modification. This makes it easier to develop and deploy Minecraft on a wide range of devices.\n 2. Large existing codebase: Minecraft has been in development since 2009, and the original codebase was written in Java. It would be a significant effort to rewrite the entire game in C++ or another language, especially since the existing codebase has been optimized and improved over the years.\n 3. Performance improvements: While Java may not be as performant as C++ for 3D games, there are ways to optimize Java code for better performance. In fact, Minecraft has undergone several performance optimizations over the years to improve its performance on lower-end hardware.\n 4. Familiarity with the language: The Minecraft development team is likely very familiar with Java, and it may be more efficient for them to continue using Java rather than learning a new language.\n Overall, while Java may not be the optimal choice for 3D games, Minecraft is still written in Java because of its cross-platform compatibility, large existing codebase, performance optimizations, and familiarity with the language.\n"

    "question": "How does weathering turn hard rock into soft soil?",
    "answer": "It’s a very long, complicated process comprising many actors. It all starts with bare rock. The formation could be brand new rock from a volcanic eruption. Or it could be rock newly exposed by a landslide, lowered water levels, or uplifted during an earthquake. Not important. Many things act upon it now that it is in the open.\n Physical weather is simply how the big solid rock breaks into smaller pieces. Changes in temperature, alternating freezing and warming cause cracks and flaking. Wind and water pound the rock, breaking off bits and pieces. The same processes that cause potholes in our highways gradually crumble exposed rock to pieces. Water fills tiny cracks, freezes and expands, enlarging the spaces. Plant roots may grow into them, and, over time, grow bigger and accomplish the same thing. Even animals walking on bare rock scrape and chip off pieces.\n Chemical weathering are the changes in the rock’s composition caused by substances in rainwater (including acid rain), in groundwater (including secretions from plant roots), and in the air. The rock itself is softened and is more vulnerable to physical weathering.\n So, the rock surface gradually changes from the above and develops a powdery, softer surface. Lo and behold! Seeds and spores in the air land on the rock, and some of them grow. If the conditions are right (moisture, not too much sun for example), moss and lichen may find a good spot and start to grow. As they grow, their roots dig into the rock surface. They secrete carbolic acid and other substances that change the rock and cause it to deteriorate. As the powdered rock gets deeper, the lichens and mosses increase in number and size.\n After a while, there is enough ‘stuff’ (dead plant materials, perhaps dead critters, fecal material, etc.) that some seeds can actually sprout and grow. These would be very tiny plants at this point. The processes continue. The layer of material gradually deepens. This becomes the soil. Soil is a very complex and complicated mixture of mineral particles, decomposed organic matter from living organisms (microorganisms, plants, animals, etc.). As the soil layer increases over many years, larger and larger plants and animals become part of it, accelerating the soil formation. Eventually, it is deep enough to sustain the living things for that ecosystem.\n How fast does this happen? The standard rate in a temperate climate like the Mid-Atlantic states is about one inch in a century. If the rock is softer (granite is much harder than limestone), this process will be faster. If the climate is warmer, it happens more quickly. And if there is more water—wetter climate—that will speed the process a lot. Valleys/pockets build up soil more than slopes for obvious reasons. The types of living things also affect the processes as well.\n"

    "question": "Android phones show a small icon if a tracking app is installed with or without the owner's knowledge, does Apple have a similar icon or notification?",
    "answer": "iOS has an icon that indicates if location services are in use. It’s a small arrow-shaped icon next to the battery.\nIf the icon is filled in, it means the current app (on the screen) is actively using your location.\n If the icon is hollow, it means geofencing is active (which could be in background app). Geofencing doesn’t allow the app to track your location in detail: rather, it notifies the app if your phone enters or leaves a certain predefined location. For example, home automation apps that turn on your lights when you get home might use this by setting a geofence for “home”.\n If a background app is really actively using your location (for example, a maps app for active navigation) iOS makes it super clear that this is going on. The notification area grows to double height and the name of the app is shown:\nYou can also control which apps have access to your location using Location Services in Privacy in the Settings app.\nYou can control settings for each app individually.\nYou can also see an explanation for why the app needs location services.\n Even better, you can see which apps have used location services recently.\nThe grey icon indicates apps which used location services during the last 24 hours. You can see a full description of the icons at the bottom of the list.\nAs you can see, iOS is really good about keeping you informed when an app is using your location.\n"

    "question": "What is difference between concave mirror and convex mirror?",
    "answer": "Concave and convex lenses are two different categories of lenses with differing qualities. First, they have very different forms. A convex lens has a bulging middle and is thicker in the middle than it is at the edges. A concave lens, on the other hand, has a dented form in the middle and is thicker at the corners than it is at the centre.\n Their capacity to converge or diverge light is where the main [LINKED_TEXT: difference between concave and convex mirror] [URL: https://88guru.com/library/physics/difference-between-concave-and-convex-mirror] lies. Converging lenses, also referred to as convex lenses, bring parallel light rays together after they have passed through the lens, eventually bringing them together at a focal point. These lenses have an advantageous focal length. Concave lenses, also known as diverging lenses, on the other hand, force parallel light rays to spread out after passing through the lens,they are diverging. Their focal length is negative.\n The two lenses have different focus points and focal lengths. The focal length of a convex lens is defined as the separation between the lens and the point at which parallel light rays converge after passing through the lens. As opposed to a convex lens, which has a virtual focal point from which parallel light rays appear to diverge after passing through the lens, the focal length of a concave lens is also determined by the distance between the lens and the virtual focal point.\n"

It was the first major defeat suffered by the German Army, which had previously been undefeated in battle. The battle saw intense urban combat as the Germans attempted to capture the city of Stalingrad (now Volgograd) and the Soviets fought to defend it. The battle ended in a decisive Soviet victory, with the Germans suffering enormous casualties and losing the initiative on the Eastern Front. The battle is often seen as a turning point in the war and a major factor in the eventual defeat of Germany.\n The Battle of Kursk, fought in July-August 1943, was the largest tank battle in history and is often seen as the turning point of the war on the Eastern Front. The Germans launched a massive offensive against the Soviet salient at Kursk, hoping to encircle and destroy the Soviet forces there. However, the Soviets had built extensive defensive fortifications and prepared an elaborate counter-attack. The battle ended in a decisive Soviet victory, with the Germans suffering massive losses in tanks and men. The battle marked the end of the German offensive capability on the Eastern Front and paved the way for the Soviet advance towards Berlin.\n In terms of importance, both battles were crucial in their own ways. The Battle of Stalingrad was the first major defeat suffered by the German Army, which had previously been undefeated in battle. It was a turning point in the war on the Eastern Front and marked the beginning of the Soviet offensive that would eventually lead to the capture of Berlin. The Battle of Kursk, on the other hand, was the largest tank battle in history and marked the end of the German offensive capability on the Eastern Front. It also paved the way for the Soviet advance towards Berlin. Both battles were significant in different ways and contributed to the eventual Allied victory in World War II.\n"

    "question": "What should I consider when selecting a pet-friendly HVAC system for my home?",
    "answer": "When it comes to selecting an HVAC system that's suitable for your pets, there are some important factors to consider. First, you need to ensure that the system you choose is compatible with your pets, taking into account their size, breed, and any specific requirements they may have. Second, consider the energy efficiency of the system you're interested in. You want your pets to be comfortable, but you also want to keep your energy bills under control. So, look for HVAC systems that are energy-efficient and have a good SEER rating. Third, the air quality in your home is also essential to consider. Pets can produce dander, hair, and other allergens that can affect the air quality of your home. Therefore, look for HVAC systems that have high-quality air filters and consider investing in additional air purifiers or cleaners. Lastly, don't forget about the maintenance needs of the HVAC system. Choose a system that's easy to maintain and has a good warranty. Regular maintenance is essential to ensure your system runs efficiently and prevent any problems that could affect your pets' comfort.\n"

    "answer": "First, find the prime factors of the number. The only even prime factor is 2, which can be ignored. The other prime factors can be divided into two sets; those that have remainder 1 when divided by 4 (e.g. 5), and those that have remainder 3 (e.g. 7). So odd primes can have the form 4k +1 or 4k+3 where k is in integer\n A positive integer can be represented as the sum of 2 squares only if each of its prime factors of the form 4k+3 occur as an even power.\n see also\n[LINKED_TEXT: Sum of Squares Function -- from Wolfram MathWorldThe number of representations of n by k squares, allowing zeros and distinguishing signs and order, is denoted r_k(n).

    "question": "Did the Empire ever reactivate the Droid Army?",
    "answer": "The Empire never reactivated the Droid Armies that were ordered to be shut down after Palpatine executed Order 66, but after falling out of favor with his master, Darth Vader ‘acquires’ a droid factory from Geonosis. He uses it to produce an army of Commando Droids that are unquestionably loyal to him, and to locate and eliminate an Imperial rival named Doctor Cylo.\nVader travelled to Geonosis after he got word that a surviving Geonosian Queen had a droid factory on the Imperial sterilised planet of Geonosis. A Geonosian named Klik Klak had kept her safe all these years. She was named after Queen Karina the great; one of Geonosis’ first queens.\nVader used force and took her factory, then used it to produce a small army of BX-Series Droid Commandos to help him in his task of eliminating Dr Cylo.\nAlthough Palpatine ordered Vader to give the shutdown command to all the Battle Droids of the Separatist Alliance, small pockets of droids resisted the order to shutdown, and continued to operate not realising that the war was over,.. and the newly formed Galactic Empire had replaced the Republic. The Empire hunted and eliminated most of these droid pockets during its formative years.\nDroids such as Kalani, a Super Tactical Droid, resisted the shutdown command believing it to be a Republic trick. He and his army of B1 Battle Droids, and Droidekas, remained in the collapsed hulk of an old Separatist DH-Omni Support Vessel on the planet of Agamar.\nKalani overrode Vaders signal during the shutdown order, and on Agamar they remained until members of the Rebel cell Phoenix Squadron came and let Kalani and his droid forces know that the Clone Wars was over; but not before he put up a valiant final effort in events that seen the Empire intervene, and swiftly cease hostilities between the Rebels and the Droid Army.\n"

    "question": "Is it hypocritical for libertarians to be pro-life?",
    "answer": "No. It’s not. The argument that Pro-Life libertarianism in an oxymoron misrepresents Libertarianism as meaning “fiscally conservative but Socially liberal”. In fact that’s not what it is. Libertarianism is a political ideology that posits that every law is by its very nature an infringement upon freedom of the individual and as such the government should not issue any laws except inasmuch as legislation is essential to the prevention of harm.\n That harm prevention bit is known as the Non-Aggression Principle. If a fetus is a human life then the Non Aggression Principle not only allows but requires legislation against abortion. And if a fetus isn’t a human life then Libertarianism would condemn any and all legislation against abortion as an infringement upon bodily autonomy.\n The dispute between Pro-Life Libertarians and Pro-Choice Libertarians is that the former believe that a fetus is a human life and as such consider abortion worthy of criminalization according to the dictates of the Non Aggression Principle whereas Pro-Choice Libertarians disagree with the assertion that the fetus is a human life and as such don’t believe that the Non Aggression Principle applies in this case.\n There is absolutely nothing whatsoever that is hypocritical about either position.\n"

Once they believe enough pain inflicted they show leniency by unblocking but also to see how keen you are to contact. More enough than not victims always take advantage of their generosity by going overboard with apologies which of course plays right into their hands.\n Narcissists usually start this nonsense when confident they have partner or acquaintance well and truly sussed. Those of independent nature likely to reciprocate by then blocking narc as a parting gesture. A kind of telepathic up yours mate farewell. Those of a people pleasing disposition do the opposite and simply get mucked around for as long as narc can be bothered.\n Moral of story.

    "answer": "★★★★★\n A group of intrepid humans attempts to save the Earth from vicious extraterrestrials in this extremely popular science-fiction adventure. Borrowing liberally from War of the Worlds, Aliens, and every sci-fi invasion film inbetween, director Roland Emmerich and producer and co-writer Dean Devlin present a visually slick, fast-paced adventure filled with expensive special effects and large-scale action sequences. The story begins with the approach of a series of massive spaceships, which many on Earth greet with open arms, looking forward to the first contact with alien life. Unfortunately, these extraterrestrials have not come in peace, and they unleash powerful weapons that destroy most of the world's major cities. Thrown into chaos, the survivors struggle to band together and put up a last-ditch resistance in order to save the human race. As this is a Hollywood film, this effort is led by a group of scrappy Americans, including a computer genius who had foreseen the alien's evil intent (Jeff Goldblum), a hot-shot jet pilot (Will Smith), and the President of the United States (Bill Pullman). While some critics objected to the film's lack of originality and lapses in logic, the combination of grand visual spectacle and crowd-pleasing storytelling proved irresistible to audiences, resulting in an international smash hit.

This is guaranteed by the theorem of expressibility of a natural number as sum of two squares. Hence, we are done.\n This [math][5 ≡ 1(mod4)][/math] is the reason that Doctor Alon Amit pointed out that:\n [math]1^2+2^2 = 5[/math]\n and of course:\n [math]3^2+4^2 = 5^2[/math] (the first primitive Pythagorean triple)\n hence:\n [math](1^2+2^2)5^2 = 5^3 => 5^2+10^2 = 5^3[/math]\n [math](3^2+4^2)5^2 = 5^4 => 15^2+20^2 = 5^4[/math]\n and so on…\n Now, we see that in case at which [math]n[/math] is even there exists positive integer [math]p[/math] such that [math]n = 2p[/math], which implies that:\n [math]a^2+b^2 = c^n => a^2+b^2 = c^{2p} => [/math]\n [math]a^2+b^2 = (c^p)^2 ...

    "question": "How do you calculate",
    "answer": "There are a few ways to calculate 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 quickly.\n One way is to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms. In this case, the first term is 1, the last term is 10, and there are 10 terms. So, the sum is equal to (1 + 10)/2 * 10 = 55.\n Another way to calculate 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 quickly is to use the \"casting out nines\" method. This method is based on the fact that the sum of the digits of any number that is divisible by 9 is also divisible by 9. In this case, the sum of the digits of 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 is 45, which is divisible by 9. So, we know that 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 is also divisible by 9. Since the sum of a multiple of 9 and another multiple of 9 is also a multiple of 9, we know that 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 is equal to 9 times some number. We can then divide 45 by 9 to get 5, which is the answer.\n Finally, we can also use a calculator to calculate 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10. This is the most straightforward method, but it may not be the quickest if you are not familiar with the calculator.\n"

    "question": "When are welds stronger than the base material?",
    "answer": "In general, whether a weld is stronger than the base material depends on a number of factors, including the type of materials used, the welding process, the design of the joint, and the skill of the welder.\n Type of Materials\n Some welding filler materials are designed to produce welds that are stronger than the base material. For instance, certain high-strength filler materials can create welds that have higher tensile strength than the base metal.\n Welding Process\n The welding process used can also affect the strength of the weld. Some processes, like Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding or Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), also known as MIG welding, can produce very strong welds if done correctly.\n Joint Design\n The design of the joint can influence the strength of the weld. For example, a properly designed and executed fillet weld or groove weld can often carry more load than the base material.\n Skill of the Welder\n The skill of the welder plays a critical role in the strength of the weld. A skilled welder who properly prepares the joint, selects the right filler material, and uses the right welding technique can produce a weld that's stronger than the base material.\n However, it's important to note that just because a weld can be stronger than the base material, it doesn't mean that it always is or should be. Depending on the application, it may be more important for the weld to have similar properties to the base material (like ductility or resistance to cracking) than to have higher strength. Additionally, a weld that's much stronger than the base material can lead to problems, because it can cause the base material to fail around the weld if the joint is subjected to high loads.\n In real-world applications, engineers aim for a balance where the welded joint is as strong as necessary, but also has the right properties for the application. This might involve choosing a filler material that matches the base material, designing the joint properly, and using the right welding process and technique.\n Friendly greetings from Bulgaria, Toni!\n"

    "question": "Is it safe to give your dog toothpaste for bad breath?",
    "answer": "It can be safe to give your dog toothpaste for bad breath, but it's important to choose a toothpaste specifically formulated for dogs. Human toothpaste often contains ingredients that can be harmful to dogs, such as xylitol, which is toxic to them. Dog toothpaste usually has a more appealing flavor to dogs and is designed to be swallowed.\n Additionally, it's important to introduce tooth brushing to your dog gradually, as some dogs may not be comfortable with the process. Start with letting your dog sniff and lick the toothpaste before progressing to brushing their teeth. You can also use other dental products, such as dental chews or water additives, to help keep your dog's mouth healthy and fresh.\n However, if your dog has persistent bad breath, it could be a sign of dental problems or other health issues. It's recommended to take your dog to the vet for a checkup and professional dental cleaning if needed. Overall, while giving your dog toothpaste for bad breath can be safe and beneficial, proper care and attention to their dental health are crucial for their overall well-being.\n Suggested Read: [LINKED_TEXT: Do THIS] [URL: https://sites.google.com/view/5-sec-mor-ritual] every morning to eliminate bad doggy breath.\n"

    "question": "Does Pink Floyd’s Dark side of the Moon album still have impact on today’s culture?",
    "answer": "Depends on what you mean.\n Are people still discovering new things in it? Well, no, cause it’s already been so thoroughly explored.\n But is its impact still felt? Yes, and it always will be because it changed the trajectory of western popular music.\n First off, DSOM was the first record intentionally engineered for headphones. It doesn’t have to be experienced that way, of course, but it was designed with that experience in mind. When you listen to it with cans on, the music doesn’t seem to be coming at you from a stage in front of you, which is how engineers at the time thought of the listener space, but rather it seems to exist all around you, and even to run through your head at times. This was an extension of the Floyd stage show, which was famous for tricks like making it sound like water was flowing down the aisles and other such outlandish effects. DSOM changed how everybody thought about making records.\n The Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band is often cited for its use of sound effects, orchestra, seamless segues, and psychedelic lyrics and soundscapes (much of it inspired by the work of Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys) but not many people are aware that another band, Pink Floyd, were producing much weirder stuff at Abbey Road at the same time, and band members sometimes popped in on each other’s sessions. The groups were mutual fans, and John was first introduced to Yoko at a Floyd show at the UFO club. DSOM took all of that and pushed it harder than the Beatles or Brian Wilson had done while keeping the music mainstream. That album demonstrated that unapologetic psych/prog rock could not only be commercially viable, but could be a monster hit.\n We live in a post-DSOM world now. You can hear its influence in everything from rock to rap. There’s no way to wash it out of our clothes anymore. It will always be influential.\n"

    "question": "How woefully unprepared are we for dangerous asteroids hitting the Earth?",
    "answer": "Not actually very unprepared at all.\n The science-fiction trope is that the killer asteroid is spotted, 6 months from impact and everyone has to rush around to send nuclear weapons to destroy it.\n However, the truth is that nuclear weapons are a terrible solution to the problem - and if the asteroid is a large one - having just 6 month of notice is simply not enough.\n So “preparedness” isn’t about having fleets of spacecraft ready to launch at any moment. It’s really about having enough good telescopes to spot a “killer asteroid” decades before it’s going to be a problem.\n That gives time for considered thinking and planning on how to deflect (not destroy) it.\n The thing is - that if you can nudge the rock by even the smallest amount a decade or so before impact - that’s plenty good enough.\n If we had time, we might send a small exploratory probe to see what the composition and shape of the asteroid is - and then plan a deflection mission that might be a rocket that could push against it - or a “gravity tug” that would fly on a close parallel course and allow mutual gravity to slowly/gently change it’s course. That’s a good thing for loosely packed asteroids and asteroids made of ice and gravel.\n So - what we need is large telescopes - computers to find and track asteroids - and databases of known asteroids and their orbital components. Re-checking orbits of potential dangers. We also need a scale of “danger”.\n It turns out that we have ALL of those things - and right now, we can detect no large asteroids that are remotely likely to cause civilization-ending damage.\n The same cannot be said of much smaller rocks - but we’re getting better and better at spotting them.\n It has to be said though that a rock that could destroy an entire city could easily get through unnoticed until it was too late to deflect. In that case, we’d hope to have time to evacuate the city. But the odds of a city-killer actually hitting a city are pretty small - generally they land in deserted areas or in the ocean. Tsunami risk starts to matter - but our tsunami warning network is pretty good now.\n"

    "answer": "Mxyzptlk is by far the more powerful character. Gojo is very powerful thanks to Infinity and Purple, which make him a very powerful threat. Infinity makes him nigh invincible to physical attacks, and Purple can bypass durability by just deleting matter. Unfortunately for him, those abilities are useless.\n Imagine a point. A dot. We are that basic to Mxyzptlk. He is a five dimensional creature. He treats time itself the way we treat length and width. He sees so much more than humans, and exists on a separate plane of existence. His realm is quite literally of imagination. What he imagines comes true. He can erase all of reality by simply unimagining it. He can turn Gojo into a cat and then send the cat into space where it becomes made of brownies, and then explodes, before being put inside of a sun, and then the sun goes in a big box, and then the box goes into another bigger sun. Something like that to him is about as difficult as scratching his nose. He also doesn’t exist like normal beings. He has no matter to destroy. Gojo manipulates quantum physics, the nature of the universe, but Mxyzptlk ignores them entirely, rewriting the rules however he wants. Gojo stands no chance.\n"

    "question": "According to a conservative relative of mine, if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency she will make the U.S. into a socialist country. Is this true?",
    "answer": "Hahaha, no.\n Your conservative relative is misinformed. While there are certainly good reasons to not like Hillary Clinton, the risk that she’d foist socialism upon the country isn’t one of them.\n Even if she could as president (she can’t, no president can), she wouldn’t. Clinton’s track record isn’t that of a socialist of any stripe. Instead, she’s proven herself pliant and friendly to corporate interests, all for bailing out banks and keeping them deregulated, for trade agreements that put corporate interests ahead of sovereignty or the public good. (It’s better-explained here: [[LINKED_TEXT: Bernie Sanders Vs Hillary Clinton: Comparing Neoliberalism To Democratic Socialism On Issues] [URL: http://www.inquisitr.com/3174833/bernie-sanders-vs-hillary-clinton-comparing-neoliberalism-to-democratic-socialism-on-issues/]])\n For context, socialism is a spectrum of political/economic organization, which ranges all the way from state-ownership-of-industry to we’re-still-capitalists-but-regulate-markets-in-the-public-interest. Clinton lands somewhere well off the spectrum, way over in neoliberal-corporatist-land, where instead of wanting government to check corporate abuse, they see the proper role of government in service of big business (or apparently, in service of folks who can afford high-powered lobbyists).\n For all that conservatives are constantly assured that democrats like Clinton (and Obama, for that matter) are secret socialists, that’s just propaganda to keep them riled up. The truth is a bit worse; establishment Democrats since the Reagan era have been of the same neoliberal stripe; they might be liberal on social policy (like women’s rights and marriage equality) but in economic terms they’ve internalized as correct the sense that the government’s role should be to strengthen corporate hands in terms of suppressing organized labor, keeping wages low, exploiting foreign labor and resources, and outsourcing public functions (like prisons and schools and warfare) to private interests.\n In this sense, Clinton might as well be a Republican- they like all the same things, in terms of economics, corporate welfare, trade policy, and keeping bank regulators toothless. But they’re going to stoke up the socialism propaganda to keep your attention focused on that stuff.\n This is all kinda fascinating to watch, in the sense that so much of America’s success is so closely related to where it’s cultivated public wealth, assets, infrastructure, and safety nets. Part of America’s success is connected to such socialist undertakings as Social Security, Medicare, Interstates (gasp, freeways instead of tollways?), ports, the military, your fire department, police, and all the other common infra/services that enable so much more. To watch us use Socialism like a political boogeyman when we use so much of it (as though we didn’t) is at least a little entertaining.\n"

    "question": "How fast could the US Air Force SR-71 Blackbird fly if it pushed its engines to the point of destruction as some MiG-25 Foxbats did chasing the Blackbird?",
    "answer": "The very fastest speed flown in an SR-71 was in SR-71A 61–7974, also known as Ichi Ban. She was the best flying of all fifty Blackbirds and just loved to fly fast.\n While assigned to Site II at Palmdale for flight test, test pilot Bill Weaver and his back seater took it 974 out for a test run after some major work was completed. Having completed their test card, and with ample fuel on board, Bill radioed back to Site II to ask permission to run the SR out to the end of its performance envelope.\n On this particular test run, the weather and temperature at 80,000 feet was perfect; 974 was the best flying of all the Blackbirds and Bill received the okay to run her out.\n At Mach 3.43, or just around 2,400 mph, 974 had a duel unstart. Both Bill and his back seater thought the SR was in the process of disintegrating around them. Bill indicated that he thought his back seater may have messed his shorts. That didn’t happen, and they were able to recover 974 and to bring her home, a little shaken, but other wise okay. Hope that answers your question. And SR-71A, 974 was okay to fly the next day.\n Cheers…..Jim Goodall\n"

    "question": "How do snow plows know where the edge of the road is and not run off?",
    "answer": "The easy and most accurate answer is “experience”. Experience helps the driver learn the details of his plow route. He or she may not know exactly where he is along the road, but he probably will recognize features along the route. Trees, rocks, mailboxes, signs, houses etc. They drive this route once every two to three hours while plowing in a snowstorm. You can walk from your bedroom to the kitchen with your eyes closed. Our drivers have a pretty good idea where they are on their 8 to 15-mile plow route.\n Some drivers are lucky enough to have delineators along the edge of the highway, likely about 4 feet off the edge of the pavement. They are usually placed along the both sides of Interstates and other major highways. Fun fact: In NH, the roadside delineators, which are 4” x 6” silver reflectors set 4 feet above the edge of pavement, are placed 20 per mile, or one every 256 feet. [5280/20=-20. Sometimes all a driver can do is try to see the next reflector through the snow or fog.\nPart B of the question is where the plow is laterally (left and right) driving along the road. Again, experience. They can sometimes see or sense if they are too far to one side or the other. If it is daylight, they might see a piece of paint centerline in their mirror. Maybe there are embankments near the road, or mailboxes, utility poles or fences that will keep them on the road. Runs of guardrail are an obvious target.\n They may not know exactly where they are, but they usually have a pretty good idea.\n"

    "question": "How does the FBI find the locations of the piracy websites like the pirate Bay?",
    "answer": "The Pirate Bay operates overseas, so the FBI has no jurisdiction. The founders were arrested and tried in Sweden, not the U.S. (But they did help investigate, rumors suggest.)\n But you say “websites like the Pirate Bay”.\n The internet is a bunch of physical cables and servers. In order to actually get data from a server, your computer has to go through these to reach fixed locations that have the data you want to download. You can obfuscate your end as a torrent user quite a bit, weaving a path through countless gimmicks, like VPNs. But the actual data store has to have a fixed and known digital location. And by asking the owners of the infrastructure the routing they used to get to a fixed IP address, it is possible to physically trace back to the location of the piracy website.\n It does require warrants to get that information from internet backbone companies and ISPs. And that final line from the ISP’s box to the actual location of the servers is controlled by the server owner, so can be another step in obfuscation. But one foiled by a technician just walking the cable line to your facility.\n Here are some articles on the FBI arresting people running torrent organizations:\n[LINKED_TEXT: Busted By The FBI: The Life Of An Elite Teen BitTorrent Uploader - TorrentFreak] [URL: https://torrentfreak.com/busted-by-the-fbi-the-life-of-an-elite-teen-bittorrent-uploader-120204/][LINKED_TEXT: Pirate Bay Paranoia Reignited By FBI Involvement In Foreign Torrent Raid] [URL: https://www.ibtimes.com/pirate-bay-paranoia-reignited-fbi-involvement-foreign-torrent-raid-2008178][LINKED_TEXT: How The FBI Dismantled a BitTorrent Community - TorrentFreak] [URL: https://torrentfreak.com/how-the-fbi-dismantled-a-bittorrent-community-080630/]\n"

    "answer": "Akbar was the third Mughal emperor. Akbar's father's name was Humayun. The word Humayun means 'fortunate', but Humayun was not fortunate at all.Humayun first ascended the throne of Delhi in 1530 after the death of his father Babur.But Humayun was not war-wise and visionary like his father. Taking advantage of Humayun's weakness, Bahadur Shah in Gujarat and the Afghans in Bihar to the east mobilized their forces.Humayun realized that his throne would not be secure unless he suppressed the Afghan power. Muhammad Lodi, son of Ibrahim Lodi, was defeated by Humayun in the Battle of Dhauria.Then he besieged Sher Khan, the ruler of Chunar Durg, in Chunar Durg. Sher Khan was the rising star of Afghan power. He was the son of the Jagirdar of Sasaram and an extraordinary military commander.When Sher Khan temporarily submitted to Humayun through diplomacy, Humayun returned to Agra without destroying Sher Khan's power.In 1537, Humayun went on a campaign against Sher Shah and captured Sher Shah's base, Chunar Fort. Sher Shah moved to Bengal without stopping Humayun. Followed Sher Shah and came to Bengal.Sher Shah bypassed him and returned to Bihar without giving him battle and upset Agra by capturing Chunar, Kanauj and Jaunpur.When Humayun realized his danger, he quickly tried to return to Delhi. In 1539 AD, Sher Shah blocked Humayun's path in the village of Chausa near Buxar and destroyed Humayun's army in the Battle of Chausa.As a result of this victory, Bengal, Bihar, East-Uttar Pradesh or Jaunpur came under Sher Shah's kingdom.Humayun returned to Agra and gathered strength again and attacked Sher Shah at Kanauj or Bilgram in 1540 AD and was completely defeated by Sher Shah. Sher Shah captured Agra and Delhi and delivered Sultani Khutba in his own name.Humayun left India and took refuge in Persia. After Sher Shah's death in 1545, Sher Shah's son ruled Delhi. In 1555 AD, Humayun returned to Delhi and occupied the throne of Delhi.But in 1556 AD, Humayun died after falling from the stairs of Delhi library.\n"

    "answer": "In the USA, the number porting process allows you to switch your phone number from one service provider to another while retaining the same number. Here's a simplified overview of the process:\n 1. Choose a new provider: Select the new mobile carrier you want to switch to and sign up for their service.\n 2. Provide information: You'll need to provide your new carrier with information such as your current phone number, account number, and sometimes a PIN or password from your current provider.\n 3. Initiate the port: The new carrier will submit a porting request to the Number Portability Administration Center (NPAC). This request includes the necessary details to transfer your number.\n 4. Verification: The NPAC verifies the information provided and confirms whether the number can be ported. This step ensures that the requested number is eligible for porting and that there are no outstanding issues with the current provider.\n 5. Contact your current provider: Your current provider will be notified of the porting request and may reach out to you to confirm the request. They might also try to retain you as a customer.\n 6. Transfer approval: Once the verification is complete and both carriers agree, the porting request is approved.\n 7. Porting process: On the scheduled porting date and time, your number will be transferred from your old provider to the new one. During this time, your service might be briefly disrupted.\n 8. Confirmation: After the port is complete, your new provider will notify you, and you should be able to use your old phone number with your new service.\n Keep in mind that the exact steps and timelines can vary slightly depending on the carriers and circumstances involved. It's recommended to double-check with your current and new providers for specific instructions and details about the porting process.\n"

Arguably, the 2 G.O.A.Ts.\n As Rooney grew older, he started going deeper and deeper into the midfield looking for the ball whenever it wasn't in the opponents box. This left Manchester United without a centre forward during counter attacks.\n Sir Alex Ferguson noticed this and started to buy centre forwards to play alongside Rooney. Berbatov, Chicharito, Tevez, Van Persie, etc. All were bought to play as out and out strikers, while Rooney led the creativity part in the No.10. A role he excelled at.\n This led to Rooney's reduction in goal scoring but increased his assists and chances created.\n Playing him in multiple positions as a utility player when someone was injured or out for one reason or another, didn't help much.\n Many Manchester United fans who don't know much about football, felt Wayne Rooney was no longer a world class player.\n The other issue is that Rooney's bulk physique couldn't allow him to play many years into his thirties. That's why he burnt out early and retired shortly after leaving Manchester United.\n Despite all the odds being against him, he went on to become the greatest player in Manchester United history.\n But make no mistake about it, Wayne Rooney was a monster of a player.

    "answer": "In general, when you study science, cheating doesn’t actually get you anywhere.\n Yes, you might pass an exam, you might get a Pass on the course when you should have had a Fail.\n But it doesn’t stop there.\n In order to understand the next course, you will have to have some understanding of the previous ones, sometimes all the way back to high school. If you have cheated your way up to here, you will not understand the basics—and crucially, when you come to the exam, you will not even understand the questions.\n If you don’t understand what they’re asking, you won’t even be able to cheat.\n You see, exams in science rarely, if ever, contain questions where you are simply required to have memorised something. Most questions will require you to apply a solution principle to a problem you haven’t seen before, usually in the form of extremely complex calculations.\n You would regularly have a problem like “Calculate how heat varies in an infinitely long steak with perfect insulation on one end when it is put in an oven where the temperature varies as [math]T = k e^{1/t}[/math]”, and your answer is not a number, but an an equation spanning two or three lines.\n You see how “cheating” isn’t actually going to get you anywhere. You can’t write down the answer beforehand, the best you can do is to memorise how to use the general method on this particular problem—which is exactly what you were supposed to do anyway. And if you cheated your way to a position where you’re even given this exam, you’re not even going to understand the question.\n Higher education in science is not about memorising stuff. It’s about applying methods.\n"

    "question": "Why is King Gyanendra regaining support in Nepal?",
    "answer": "Its been told that a Royal Soothsayer predicted on the birth of Gyanendra Shah ,this child will ascend to Nepal’s throne thrice.\n Gyanendra shah being a second son of King Mahendra was not in direct lineage to deserve throne but somehow he managed to indeed ascend to throne twice already.\n In Novemeber 1950, during a political plot against Rana Regime, then King Tribhuwan, then King fled with his family to New Delhi leaving Gyanendra behind. Rana ruler Mohan Shamsher picked Gyanendra to make a shadow king on 7 November 1950.He remained king for almost 3 months till his grandfather returned.\n Later, after the Royal Massacre, Gyanendra became King as apparent heir of throne among the survivors on 4th June 2001.\n His second term as a king was ride of roller-coaster. Suspicion of his nature and allegation of his involvement in Royal Massacre was widespread. Meanwhile, political parties took advantage of this sentiment and removed him as King on people’s movement in 2008.\n Now, after almost 12 years a huge bunch of people are keenly looking for reestablishment of monarchy in the country after disappointment with the political parties who failed to keep promises.\n Sentiment of people is that It is better to be robbed by lone king rather hundreds of petty-kings, referring corrupt bureaucrats and politicians.\n In Last several years,Rastriya Prajatantra Party, a political party with monarchy and hindusim are leading group of supporters with protests, rallies and social media movement to establish kingship again.\n We can see whenever Gyanandra makes visit around the temple of the various parts of country and attends various programs. People throng to see him as he is still in the power.\n As Monarchy supportive Priest of Gorakhnath Math, Yogi Adityanath of the neighboring India is now in seat of Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. It gives radiant hope for seekers of monarchy herein Nepal.\n As Combodia reinstated Naroddam Sinhanuk as King even after abolishment of Monarchy, We can just watch and wait.\n"

    "question": "What are the benefits of a wide display versus a bigger display?",
    "answer": "A wide display and a bigger display offer distinct advantages depending on the specific use cases and personal preferences of the user. Here are some benefits of each:\n Benefits of a wide display:\n 1. Enhanced multitasking: A wide display, often with an aspect ratio of 16:9 or 21:9, provides additional horizontal screen real estate. This extra width allows for better multitasking by enabling you to have multiple windows or applications open side by side without overlapping or crowding.\n 2. Productivity boost: With a wide display, you can view more content simultaneously, which can enhance productivity. It's especially useful for tasks that involve working with multiple documents, spreadsheets, or editing videos or images. The wider workspace allows for easier comparison, referencing, and manipulation of content.\n 3. Immersive entertainment: Many movies, TV shows, and games are designed to take advantage of a wider aspect ratio. A wide display can offer a more immersive experience by filling your field of vision and providing a broader viewing angle, making it particularly appealing for cinematic experiences and gaming.\n 4. Better document and web browsing: The wider screen allows you to view documents, web pages, and emails with less scrolling and zooming, providing a more natural reading experience. It reduces the need to constantly switch between different sections of a document or webpage.\n Benefits of a bigger display:\n 1. Larger content viewing: A bigger display, usually measured in diagonal inches, offers a larger canvas for content consumption. Whether you're watching movies, viewing photos, or browsing the web, a bigger display can showcase the content in a visually impactful manner, with larger text, images, and videos.\n 2. Improved readability: If you have visual impairments or prefer larger text, a bigger display can be advantageous. It allows you to increase the font size without sacrificing the amount of content visible on the screen. This can be beneficial for reading books, articles, or any text-heavy material.\n 3. Enhanced visual detail: A larger display can present finer details more prominently. Whether you're editing photos or videos, analyzing intricate designs, or simply appreciating high-resolution content, a bigger screen can make it easier to see and work with minute elements.\n 4. Greater screen immersion: While a wide display offers a wider field of view, a bigger display can provide a heightened sense of immersion. This is especially true for activities like gaming or watching movies where the larger screen can make you feel more engaged in the content.\n Ultimately, the choice between a wide display and a bigger display depends on your individual needs, preferences, and the primary tasks you intend to perform. It's worth considering the specific aspect ratio, resolution, and size options available in the market to find the display that best suits your requirements.\n"

    "question": "What happens when a title search doesn't find an HOA associated with a house that is being purchased then the HOA president claims the title search company made a mistake and the house belongs to the HOA?",
    "answer": "First of all, an HOA is a local neighborhood governing body created by the developer of a tract of lots. It does not own any house. The houses lots that the developer originally put into the HOA are bound by that contract of the HOA and it encumbers the property and passes along to all future owners of the property. So, if a title search failed to find and identify an HOA attaching to your property, then there is a good chance none so exists. HOAs are well known for trying to claim that all properties in their neighborhood are part of the HOA. The HOAs are frequently wrong, as any property not part of the devopment that created the HOA won’t be part of it unless the property owner subsequently agreed to join and burden their property with the HOA contract as an encumbrance. That the HOA claims it is, simply means you should demand they show proof of a legally recorded deed encumbering your property.\n Now, if in fact your title search did make a mistake, then as to the property being encumbered by an HOA agreement .. it is what it is. That encumbrance does not go away simply because your title search made an error. Of course if you got title insurance based on that title report and the insurance did not make an exception for an HOA encumbrance, they you have a claim against the insurance. If you have the title report but no insurance, then if the company that furnished the title report is in error, you have a lawsuit against them. You certainly might begin by contacting that title report company and informing them that the HOA asserts it encumbers your property and see what the report company has to say in response and what actions they offer to undertake to clear or quiet your title.\n If the title company assures you there is no HOA encumbrance, then your response to the HOA should include that fact and a demand by you that they withdraw their claim as it is a “slander of title” against your property and you will hold then responsible for damages if they continue without clearing that claim of encumbrance.\n"

    "question": "What is the average speed of a meteor before and after entering Earth's atmosphere?",
    "answer": "The speed of a meteoroid as it hurtles through space can vary widely depending on its size, composition, and origin. On average, though, meteoroids zip through our solar system at speeds ranging from about 25,000 to 160,000 miles per hour (40,000 to 257,500 kilometers per hour).\n As it plummets toward the ground, the meteoroid is subjected to intense friction and pressure, which cause it to heat up and start glowing – transforming it into a meteor. During this process, the meteor's speed is affected by several factors, including its size, shape, and the density of the atmosphere.\n While meteors can still reach incredible speeds as they streak through Earth's atmosphere, their velocity generally decreases due to the drag force acting against them. It's difficult to pinpoint an exact average speed for meteors after entering the atmosphere, as it can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances. However, it's safe to say that they're still moving at a breakneck pace – often tens of thousands of miles per hour – as they light up the night sky.\n"

    "question": "Which regions of Texas were settled by people from Appalachia?",
    "answer": "Predominantly east Texas, the part that’s covered in the piney woods from Texarkana down to Beaumont, and from Liberty up to Tyler.\n Other peoples settled there, and Appalachians settled in other parts of Texas, too, but that’s where the biggest concentration of them are. It’s a little like the Old South that way.\n Both the Gulf Coast and the Dallas area are more cosmopolitan, as those two areas have grown tremendously in the 20th century. The Houston area is extraordinarily diverse, with large black, Hispanic, and Asian populations. Over 70 languages are spoken in homes in this region.\n Central Texas has a strong German heritage. It was a focal point for German immigration in the latter half of the 19th century.\n Southern Texas has a heavy Mexican influence. This extends as far north as San Antonio but is very predominant in the lower Rio Grande valley.\n West Texas is so sparsely settled that you can’t say most west Texans are from anywhere. Somewhat the same, but less so, for the Panhandle, up by Lubbock and Amarillo.\n But east Texas is so Appalachian that it hurts. It’s an interesting mix in Nacogdoches, which is an old Caddo Indian settlement that became a Spanish mission town that became an east Texas Anglo settlement.\n"

    "question": "What are some examples of unusual creativity at its best?",
    "answer": "Dear Hal,\n Tell us the story of Rudy Kurniawan.\n Sure Dave!\n “In the world of fine wine, few names have attracted as much attention and controversy as Rudy Kurniawan. Once dubbed the \"King of Counterfeit Wine,\" Kurniawan's journey from being an infamous fraudster to an inspiring figure in the wine industry is a story worth telling.\n Born in Indonesia, Rudy Kurniawan moved to the United States in the early 2000s, where he quickly gained a reputation as a lavish spender with a discerning palate. His seemingly bottomless pockets and extravagant wine collection soon made him the toast of the town among elite wine connoisseurs. However, behind the veneer of extravagance lay a dark secret. Kurniawan had been meticulously producing counterfeit bottles of rare and expensive wines, fooling even the most experienced oenophiles.\n In 2012, the FBI arrested Kurniawan, and in 2013, he was convicted for his crimes. But it was during his time in prison that the seeds of redemption began to sprout. Kurniawan devoted himself to learning everything there was to know about wine, from the intricacies of terroir to the art of viticulture.\n Upon his release in 2021, Kurniawan embarked on an unlikely journey of reinvention. Determined to make amends for his past transgressions, he became an active advocate for transparency and authenticity in the wine industry. His efforts focused on educating collectors and enthusiasts about the importance of provenance and verifying the history of fine wines.\n One remarkable example of his commitment to this cause was when Kurniawan organized a charity auction to raise funds for victims of a devastating earthquake in Indonesia. He carefully curated a selection of authentic wines from his personal collection and worked tirelessly to ensure their provenance could be verified. The event raised substantial funds for the cause and demonstrated Kurniawan's newfound dedication to integrity in the world of wine.\n Beyond his advocacy work, Kurniawan has used his unique knowledge and skills to develop innovative tools to combat counterfeiting in the wine industry. He has partnered with experts in the field of technology to create a groundbreaking wine authentication system that combines blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and advanced chemical analysis. The system has already garnered praise for its potential to revolutionize the industry and protect collectors from fraud.\n Rudy Kurniawan's transformation from an infamous con man to an inspiring figure is a testament to the power of redemption and the capacity for change. His commitment to righting the wrongs of his past and his dedication to ensuring the integrity of the wine world have earned him the respect and admiration of many in the industry. Today, Kurniawan's story serves as a reminder that even the most unlikely heroes can emerge from the shadows of infamy.”\n "

    "question": "What does it mean when you dream about a black cat who knocked at your house and came without asking? The cat was smiling weirdly and has a child head and hands.",
    "answer": "Dreams about cats are often associated with mystery, intuition, and independence. In your dream, the black cat knocking at your door without asking suggests that you are being presented with an opportunity to take a risk and explore new possibilities in your life. The smiling cat with a child's head and hands can be interpreted as a sign that you need to tap into your own inner child and be open to new experiences and ideas.\n It is important to remember that the decisions you make in your dream are not necessarily indicative of what you should do in real life. However, it is important to think about the potential opportunities and risks that this dream is presenting to you. Consider what areas of your life may need to be explored or developed and whether the risks are worth taking.\nDreams are not meant to provide definitive answers, but rather to open up new possibilities and reflections. Take the time to think about what this dream may mean for you and consider how you can use this experience to explore new opportunities.\n As the Chinese proverb goes, “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” Take a step today and explore the possibilities the dream presented to you.\n Disclaimer: This answer is created by Neo Therapy AI mood & dream journal app. Download and keep dream journals with interpretations, inspirational quotes & painting of your dreams.\n Available on Apple Store: [LINKED_TEXT: ‎Neo Therapy - Mental awareness] [URL: https://apps.apple.com/app/neo-therapy-mental-awareness/id6443898185]\n"

    "question": "Could you dig a tank turret or a battleship turret in the ground and the turret sticking out of the top? Wouldn't that be more effective than having an open bunker on top of a hill?",
    "answer": "You could, as others mention this has been done. In fact, WWII Germany built a self-propelled gun that was basically a tank that could remove its own turret! It could drive up to a position, hoist its own turret up, then set it down on top of the position.\n [LINKED_TEXT: Heuschrecke 10 - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuschrecke_10]\n But honestly, this is kind of overkill because now you need to build a more complicated vehicle. And complication is a bad thing. You’d be better off digging a berm, then parking the tank behind the berm. Then, when you have to leave, you can take your turret with you! That’s a big part of modern MBT doctrine. Tanks look for positions behind ridgelines and berms, park there to cover their turret from potential enemy fire, and have the TC look for enemies. When he spots some, the tank pulls up to a hull-down position, the gunner fires at the enemy, the tank pulls back down, and the procedure is repeated as needed. When the position becomes untenable, the whole tank just leaves and can fight again another day. You can’t do that with bunkers.\n"

Forest is a place filled with goodness compared to a city where people are very passionate. Also, you can live with sadhus who will guide/help you in the spiritual journey.\n It is always good to find a forest and meditate. And there would be so many good places still untouched by materialism.\n However, nowadays the forests and hills are filled with tourist camps and most people visit these places for materialistic activities. Thus there is not much respite you can find there. And the sadhus are also not to be seen as in the older ages.\n Srila Prabhupada realized that such forests are no longer great destinations for spiritual growth. Hence he constructed temples and created ashrams around it where a sincere seeker can stay away from society. Staying in the association with sadhus will help you to progress faster in your spiritual life.\nISKCON temples are constructed with these purposes. You can visit ISKCON temple nearby and talk to the guides there.\n "

Lasting anywhere from a few milliseconds to several minutes, GRBs shine hundreds of times brighter than a typical supernova and about a million trillion times as bright as the Sun.\n Theoretically speaking, a quasar outputs 10^39 joules of energy per second.\n Whereas a Gamma-Ray Burst outputs an energy of 10^44 joules per second.\n So a Gamma-Ray-Burst has higher energy/power output than a quasar. If Superman can absorb the energy of the either one, then the Gamma-Ray-Burst will charge Superman to a greater extent.\n  Now, iirc then DC's suns are more powerful than real world's sun.

Likewise, “where” was said like hwar, “when” was hwenne, “white” was hwit, and “whine” was hwinan. If you can think of a word that starts with wh-, chances are it used to be spelled hw-. (Not all, though: some words, such as whole, never were, and were only mistakenly given the spelling.)\n So why would it change? Well, there’s a funny little thing called metathesis.

    "answer": "Xenomorphs in Alien are dangerous due to a combination of several factors.\n 1 - Woefully unprepared crews. In the first movie there are exactly 7 people and they are civilians with no military-grade equipment. Things aren’t that much better in the sequel, there are only a few colonial marines, and later some guards from a penal colony and some mercenaries.\n 2 - Surprise factor. For the most part, either nobody believes these aliens exists, or everyone underestimates them severely. And they get easily ambushed and butchered.\n 3 - Technology. Other than starships and some medical equipment, commonly used tech in Alien isn’t far more advanced than ours. Weapons are not that different from what’s used today, as well as body armor. There are no shields, no force fields, no teleportation, and few sensors/electronics.\n An old and very common Klingon D-7 ship houses a crew of over 400, most of them being experienced warriors in addition to whatever task they perform on the starship. They are armed with disruptors, and if invaded they can use their ship tech to their advantage (advanced sensors and force fields can find, identify and contain Xenomorphs safely, their fluids can’t melt energy fields, and they have no technical knowledge or capability to disable them).\n Klingon medical tech might be less advanced than that of Starfleet, so maybe they wouldn’t be able to remove alien parasites from infected hosts, but they’d at least be able to identify them and vaporize both hosts and infection.\n"

    "question": "Can mammograms lead to breast cancer?",
    "answer": "Mammography is a method of doing x-ray studies of the breast. Since it used x-rays, a small dose of x-rays is delivered to the breast tissues. This dose is much less than diagnostic x-ray done more commonly such as x-ray of the chest.\n Now cancer development due to exposure to x-ray is not a dose dependent effect. It is what is called as a stochastic effect or a chance occurrence. So theoretically, the risk of developing cancer after getting x-ray mammography can not be zero. However, the amount of radiation received in mammography is very very low. We tend to get more radiation from background radiation exposure in the atmosphere from various sources.\n In view of the theoretical risk that is there with any x-ray exposure, mammography is not usually recommended for women before the age of 40 years, especially when it comes to screening mammography. Before this age, only women who are suspected to have cancer or are being investigated for cancer due to symptoms may be advised mammography by a trained specialist.\n When it comes to screening mammography, the benefit that is there from it is much more than any risk related to radiation exposure from mammography in the populations that it has been recommended.\n"

This is an annual publication that lists the official and complete text of federal agency regulations. Once ATF decides that a regulation needs to be added, changed, or deleted, it typically publishes a proposed rule in the Federal Register to ask the public for comments. After ATF considers public feedback and makes changes where appropriate, we then publish a final rule in the Federal Register with a specific date for when the rule will become effective and enforceable. When ATF issues a final rule for comment, we must describe and respond to the public comments we received.

    "question": "Do prisoners in Guantanamo Bay get better healthcare than immigrants trying to cross the border?",
    "answer": "Yes. It’s because there are fewer prisoners in Guantanamo Bay than there are immigrants trying to cross the border.\n The inmates are in a very controlled environment and have been doing so for a long time. The strain they put on their medical facilities has become small.\n The immigrants come from countries where many tropical diseases run rampant and so start out with many more problems than the current set of Guantanamo inmates.\n In the beginning, the Guantanamo inmates had their share of tropical diseases, malnutrition, and so on; but those are long since resolved. In fact, there were some stories about how obesity was becoming a problem amongst the inmates there. They’d never had a chance to eat so much delicious halal food and the ones under high security didn’t have much chance to exercise. The low security groups had soccer fields and so forth, leading to the famous Rush Limbaugh ‘Club Gitmo’ skits.\n All in all, the United States is way, way, way too kind to those who take advantage of our good natures.\n"

    "question": "Can stress damage your brain?",
    "answer": "Stress can have a profound impact on people's minds, affecting them in various ways. Here are some of the key ways in which stress can impact individuals:\nCognitive Function: High levels of stress can impair cognitive function, leading to difficulties with memory, concentration, and decision-making. It becomes challenging to focus and retain information, affecting productivity and performance.Emotional Well-being: Stress often triggers negative emotions such as anxiety, irritability, and mood swings. Prolonged exposure to stress can contribute to the development or exacerbation of mental health conditions like depression and anxiety disorders.Sleep Disruption: Stress can disrupt sleep patterns, making it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep. Lack of quality sleep further contributes to cognitive impairment, mood disturbances, and decreased overall well-being.Physical Health: Chronic stress can manifest in physical symptoms such as headaches, muscle tension, gastrointestinal issues, and weakened immune system. It can also contribute to the development or worsening of various health conditions like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders.Relationship and Social Impact: Stress can strain relationships and social interactions. It may lead to increased conflict, withdrawal from social activities, and a sense of isolation. This can further impact one's mental health and overall quality of life.Coping Mechanisms: Individuals under stress may resort to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as excessive alcohol or drug use, overeating, or engaging in risky behaviors. These behaviors can further exacerbate mental health issues and create a cycle of negative effects.\nIt's important to note that everyone responds to stress differently, and the impact can vary from person to person. While some individuals may be more resilient, others may be more susceptible to the effects of stress. It's crucial to recognize and address stress effectively through healthy coping strategies, self-care, seeking support, and managing stressors to promote overall mental well-being.\n"

    "question": "If the gold standard is a conservative ideal, why was Nixon the one who destroyed it, and why has no conservative president tried to restore it?",
    "answer": "It’s not really a conservative idea. It’s a libertarian idea, they’re just considered a subset of conservatives in America.\nIn America we tend to try to group everyone into two groups; conservatives and progressives. But really both of these groups consist of may smaller groups that vote as a combined block. If you’re not an American, think of our political parties as akin to the coalitions in a parliamentary system.\nWith that in mind the term conservative can refer to many different groups. Among them are; fiscal conservatives, social conservatives, religious conservatives, libertarians, etc…\nAmerican Libertarians are people who have taken the maxim “That government is best which governs least” to heart. They want to minimize government, especially federal government, interference in daily life. And some of them want to return America to the gold standard.\n The idea is that a fiat currency puts too much power in government hands. At any moment the federal government has the power to determine how much your money is worth. And at this moment they’re using that power to slowly inflate the currency, essentially taking the money right out of your bank account.\nBut Richard Nixon wasn’t a libertarian. He felt that having a fiat currency, and the power it would give the federal government, was a good thing. And the majority of the country either agrees with this, or more likely, doesn’t care enough about the issue to press it.\n"

    "question": "Primary Charge Parity Violations",
    "answer": "The LHC proton beams were activated on 23 May to start the current set of searches for new physics, the primary projects being (1) refining and improving on the properties of the Higgs boson, specifically its decay modes and particle interactions, (2) making more precise measurements of the top quark, (3) looking for any discrepancies between Standard Model (SM) predictions and measurements of key parameters, (4) using the LHCb detector to pick up any traces of charge-parity violation, which would help explain the matter-antimatter imbalance in the universe, and (5) continuing investigations of the quark-gluon plasma with the ALICE detector. Beyond these ongoing activities, there are a number of other areas of potential research that CERN could focus on that lie within the few-TeV range of the collider: (1) gauge hierarchy stability signals that could be in the range from W/Z masses on up; (2) minimal supersymmetric SM, or MSSM, extensions that could give rise to TeV-scale particles; (3) heavier Higgs bosons, including a possible charged Higgs; (4) technicolor particles, such as technivector mesons and other technihadrons in the 1–5 TeV range (technicolor is a theory of as yet undetected non-Abelian gauge field interactions); and (5) extra dimensions (compactified Kaluza-Klein) revealed through signals of particle-antiparticle pair decay products of RS graviton excitations (Randall-Sundrum theory postulating warped 5-D AdS spacetime with TeV-scale compactification).\n"

    "question": "How are special forces units primarily meant for nautical incidents, like Navy SEALs and Special Boat Service, trained differently from other special forces?",
    "answer": "Units such as the SBS have some very specific tasks they need to train for that their land based cousins might not cover. For example one of their roles is to take back a hijacked oil rig so they train in methods for climbing up the oil rig legs which can be hundreds of feet high and in rough seas. After they’ve had their energy sapped in climbing up they still then have to fight to take back the rig.\nThey might insert close to the oil rig via submarine. As in a submerged submarine so they use the submarines airlock to get out while underwater. This is extremely dangerous and requires a ton of training, it’s not unheard of for men to die in these training exercises.\n They also train to take back hijacked ships. Similar to the oil rig in that they have to climb the sides of the ship, usually from their own boat which is being driven alongside. Ferries crossing the British waters are sometimes used on training exercises by British forces.\nThe above pic is actually from a Royal Marine exercise but you get the idea. The SBS mainly recruit from the Royal Marines.\n Plus they specialise in things like beach reconnaissance, port reconnaissance (spying on enemy ships) and beach landings. A very traditional tool that the SBS often use in these tasks is the klepper canoe. Part of the SBS training is to paddle these canoes for miles in a time limit including portage for miles also (carrying the canoe on land).\n"

The significance of the word 96 among Konkanis is that 96 villages formed the core region of Goa. It is said that 96 clans / families of Saraswat Brahmins arrived to Gomantak and settled in one village each. 66 villages were in Sashti region (66 in Sanskrit is ṣaṭ ṣaṣṭi, षट् षष्टि. Sashti became Salcette during Portuguese rule) and 30 villages were in Tiswadi region.\nWhile Shenvi is the original surname, currently Shenvikars use surnames of it’s derivatives and different spellings in different regions. You can tell which is the native region of a Shenvikar is, based on their surname alone. There are a few exceptions due to recent migrations due to jobs, but these apply for most cases:\nMost Goan Shenvikars use Sinai. Some of them use Shenvi, Shenoi or Shenai. During Portuguese rule, they used Xennoi and Xennai. These two have fallen out of fashion now.Shenvikars of North Canara, Sagara, Hosanagara and Belgaum use Shanbhag.Shenvikars of South Canara, Kochi and other regions of South Kerala, Kasaragod, Thirthahalli, Chikkamagaluru use Shenoy.\nAnswered for “Can you explain the origin of Shenvi/Sinai in GSB surnames?”.\n"

They will not be pushed around by anyone and if anyone tries, they will be hit as hard as NK can hit.\n But China and Russia know this really well so China does not ever demand NK to do anything. They don’t stop NK from using nukes either. What they do is that they explain their position, their worries, their fears and asks for NK’s help in allaying those fears. Becasue they treat NK how NK expects to be treated, with equality and erspect, they always listen and do what their friend needs them to do.\n But they expect reciprosity from China and they get it too. If they go to China for money, there is no threat to it and no trade of this favor for that.

Points also tend to have a higher value per redemption than miles.\n On the other hand, miles are more useful for frequent travellers, as they can be redeemed for flights, hotel stays, and other travel-related expenses. Miles may also offer higher redemption value than points when used for travel.\n Ultimately, the worth of credit card rewards depends on how you plan to use them. If you're not a frequent traveller, points may be a better option for their flexibility and higher redemption value.

    "question": "How can I get my pressure gauge to return to zero?",
    "answer": "To get a pressure gauge to return to zero, you can perform the following steps:\nDisconnect the pressure gauge: Turn off the source of pressure and disconnect the gauge from the system or device it was measuring.Depressurize the gauge: Release any pressure trapped in the gauge by slowly and steadily loosening the bleed valve or vent plug on the gauge until the needle drops to zero.Tap the gauge: Gently tap the gauge with your finger or a small tool to help the needle return to zero. Avoid tapping too hard, as this can damage the gauge or cause the needle to overshoot the zero mark.Reconnect the gauge: Reconnect the gauge to the system or device it was measuring and turn the source of pressure back on.Confirm zero reading: Check to see if the gauge is reading zero again after reconnecting it to the system. If it is not reading zero, repeat the above steps until the gauge is properly calibrated.\nIt is important to regularly calibrate and maintain pressure gauges to ensure accurate readings and reliable performance. If you find that your gauge is not returning to zero or is consistently showing inaccurate readings, it may be time to replace the gauge or have it professionally calibrated.\n"

    "question": "Why does modern English have so less Celtic words than Franco-Greco-Latin ones, even though the Anglo-Saxons and the Celts were intertwined for most of their history while the French kings ruled only conquer and rule England in a few short decades?",
    "answer": "Celtic words in French are nearly all restricted to farming because the Latin speaking overclass were city dwellers so regional farming terms survived. Celtic languages and Latin also existed side by side for around 500 years with the native leadership adopted Latin rather than a completely new leadership imposed over the population.\n In Britain the Anglo-Saxons did their own farming so even where they took over regions with Celtic speaking farmers they had those Anglo-Saxon farming terms around to influence the Celtic speakers.\n That said, upland shepherding in northern England preserved a system of counting sheep that appears to have been a survival of Celtic referred to as yan-tan-tethra. There may have been other survivals prior to the industrial revolution that died out with the changing of technology and changes to farming.\n The Normans introduced a lot of words into English while they were in the ascendancy and Anglo-Norman French was the language of the upper classes for 300 years. That’s more than enough time to introduce words from a prestige language to one of lower prestige.\n"

    "question": "How much damage could German battleship Bismarck cause if it continued raiding allied convoys?",
    "answer": "Original question: How much damage could German battleship Bismarck cause if it continued raiding allied convoys?\n A lot!\nIf Bismarck managed to get within sight of a convoy otherwise undetected, havoc would ensue. With her speed of up to 30 knots, she could travel from the horizon to the middle of the convoy in a remarkably short space of time, whilst any ship she could see would be in range of her 15 inch guns.\n ‘Fast’ Atlantic convoys usually ran at about 10 knots, ‘Slow’ at more like 6 knots: for between 30–70 merchant vessels, there could be as few as four or as many as 10 escorts. The main job of the escorts was to protect against submarines: a mixture of destroyers, frigates, sloops and corvettes in some cases not much faster than the merchant ships. When surface ship aggression was anticipated, convoys were sometimes further escorted by older battleships with some further attendant destroyers: whilst these ships had big enough main guns to damage or sink a ‘Bismarck’, they were not fast enough to chase one and they played more of a deterrent role.\n But Bismarck was never intended to operate alone. For example on Operation Rhine (Rhineubung), she sailed in company with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen and as many U-boats as possible were also at sea in the Atlantic. Similarly, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau sortied together on commerce raids. It was considered (by both sides) relatively unlikely that Bismarck would encounter a whole convoy without warning, and the standard procedure was to scatter the convoy as soon as such contact became inevitable. Scattering would reduce Bismarck’s opportunity to sink as many ships, but the U-boats should then be able to find relatively easy pickings amongst the scattered and unescorted merchants.\nThe best example of such an event involved Bismarck’s sister, Tirpitz and an Arctic convoy. PQ17 was a convoy from Iceland to Russia, sailing in the summer of 1942. Pre-warned by radio intelligence of a likely surface ship raid on the convoy, the Admiralty was suitably alarmed when they found that Tirpitz had left her moorings in a fjord in northern Norway and assumed that she was heading for the convoy: she was actually moving anchorages to meet up with other ships prior to a sortie. Despite the presence of a powerful covering force including two battleships, and despite the convoy having a relatively large close escort group, the Admiralty ordered the convoy to scatter and that’s when the problems started….\n There are several excellent books on the story of Convoy PQ17. In brief, the unescorted merchant ships became easy prey for hunting U-boats and for Luftwaffe torpedo bombers based in Norway. Of the 35 merchant ships in the original convoy, only 11 made it to a Russian port. It was a major success for the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe and an enormous embarrassment for the Royal Navy. It caused severe problems for the British with both the Russians and the Americans.\n"

    "question": "Why are expensive private middle and high schools worth it? I guess a 1:6 teacher to student ratio is pretty good, but are the teachers better at teaching or is it just something that the affluent can brag about?",
    "answer": "The main advantage of the non public schools is that, on balance the parent/s are more engaged in the outcome.\n One of the most notable facts about educational outcome is not so much the progress (or lack thereof) made from Sept til May as measured by the standardized tests. It is the amount of RETENTION (or lack thereof) between May and Sept.\n Almost ALL sudents show some loss of skills and knowledge over the Summer, but those with more engaged parents and more structure REGRESS LESS and RETAIN MORE over the Summer break than those that get less attention and structure.\n Every year students start the school year on an uneven basis with some starting each year having lost less ground in skills and knowledge and some more. The first weeks of every school year recap and recover the material of the previous year then the new material is introduced.\n Those that LOSE LESS (and RETAIN MORE) over the Summer struggle less with the new material and have more classroom success, get more positive attention and have less stress. As each school year proceeds some students have to work harder to keep up and school is less enjoyable and more like work with less enjoyment of achievement and as the years continues the students realize that some others are ahead while they are behind.\n This process repeats every school year. By the time a student reaches 7th or 8th grade they have become accustomed to either succeeding and enjoying learning at school or viewing school as an increasingly difficult place to be.\n As the curriculum advances in High School many of those that have fallen the furthest behind start to lose interest and disengage, attendance starts to fall and the distractions of puberty get in the way of school success\n Private schools tend to have a student body more likely to have access to activities and programs over the Summer that reduce REGRESSION and increase RETENTION.\n Things like day camps and church camps and programs and library Summer reading and book clubs and day trips to museums and parks all serve to engage kids minds and reinforce skills they picked up during the school year.\n Private schools are much more orderly environments than public schools and students report much less stress and fear than public schools and private school teachers report much less student disruption than public school educators. But even public school students progress from Sept to May. Even students in the most under resourced and most disorderly of public schools show adedemic progress over the school year. So there is proof that learning is happening and students can and do progress even in the “worst” public schools.\n The difference in student achievement over time appears to be what happens from May til Sept. Or, what does not happen.\n"

    "question": "How do I resolve a fire fighting wet system. if the alarm check valve inlet pressure gauge and outlet pressure gauge are showing different pressures (Inlet pressure 145psi and Outlet 200psi)? What may be the problem?",
    "answer": "There may be nothing to resolve.\n It is not unusual for the system side to have a higher pressure than the inlet side. The pressure on the system side is trapped by the alarm (check) valve.\n The pressure on the inlet side varies over time due to demand on the system, pressure surges; supply-side system valves opening and dropping pressure, and supply-side system valves slamming shut causing pressure surges or spikes. These pressure surges lift the alarm (check valve) allowing the higher pressure in, and then when the pressure drops, the alarm (check) valve closes trapping the higher pressure in the system.\n Higher pressure in the system can be beneficial. Higher pressure means that the alarm (check) valve will rarely open, reducing the possibility of false alarms if the system is connected to a fire alarm system. The only drawback could be if the pressure is higher than the maximum allowed by the system design.\n If this is the case, the excess pressure could be bled off by opening the inspector’s test drain. In the US, at the most remote point of the system is a drain valve called the inspector’s test drain. It is designed to simulate the flow of a single sprinkler head. If you very briefly opened this valve, you could drop pressure somewhat on the system side. The downside to doing this is you may trip the fire alarm if one is connected to the system, as that is the purpose of the inspectors' test drain. Another option is to briefly open the main drain. However, the main drain is large and may quickly drop the system pressure down to the same as the supply side, leaving you open to the possibility that a surge will trip the fire alarm more easily.\n A qualified sprinkler system technician can easily check to see if it is an issue and correct it.\n"

They can be helpful later on for specific things once you have a solid understanding of how to apply them to your voice, but for learning basics they're pretty much useless. A video can't hear you, or tell you what you specifically need in order to improve, or check if you are practicing or doing something correctly or not. Find a song teacher and take a few lessons instead. Two lessons with a qualified song teacher will help you more than any video anywhere online.\n Exercises can be incredibly effective for improving your singing, as long as you pay close attention to what you're doing. There's nothing magical about scales or any other exercise, and if you're singing scales without paying attention to how you're singing them, then you're mostly just wasting your time. This is true for any kind of exercise or for practicing at all. However, If you listen closely to what you're doing while you sing those scales, know what to listen for, and correct whatever needs improvement, then your singing will almost inevitably improve.\n A good teacher can tell you what would be useful for you to practice, and they can teach you how to practice those things well and efficiently. In the long run, you can also learn how to teach yourself from this.\n"

This might be 20 amps.\n But when running, the motor needs 7 amps.\n You do the math over the full 2–3 hours , and the number of starting seconds, to the number of running seconds.’\n You will see the answer is obvious.\n More insulation.\nthanks to [LINKED_TEXT: Jeff Fritz] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Jeff-Fritz-1] for a very good Central Heating question.\n"

    "question": "How can the crew of a submarine know the exact place they are in the World when the submarine is submerged? How can they navigate accurately knowing the position they are? Similarly, how can subs avoid collision with seamounts and rocky outcrops?",
    "answer": "They will surely know where they were when they first submerged or even left the dock. Docks are well surveyed and GPS fixes can be made when the antennas are above water. Active Sonar is not used while submerged is not used for stealth reasons, plus you cannot use the relatively short range of radar to find yourself in a global setting.\n Subs have very precise inertial navigation systems. They use precision spinning gyroscopes to measure 2-D acceleration of the vessels as it speeds up and slows down. Numerical integration and double integration of the acceleration data will provide speed and distance values which can be plotted to get a relatively accurate position on the earth. While depth is easily ascertained by pressure reading. Errors in measuring acceleration when integrated will add up to progressively larger distance errors with time. So the total accuracy is limited by duration among other things. Still hundreds of meters or a few km or miles is nothing when you are in the deep ocean thousands of miles across.\n"

    "question": "Can we bake a cake in a glass bowl?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can bake a cake in a glass bowl, but there are some important considerations to keep in mind:\nChoose the right type of glass: Not all glass bowls are suitable for baking. Make sure to use a heat-resistant glass bowl, such as borosilicate glass, that is specifically labeled as oven-safe. Regular glass bowls may shatter or crack under high temperatures, so it's essential to use the appropriate type of glass.Adjust the baking time and temperature: Glass conducts heat differently than metal baking pans, so you may need to adjust the baking time and temperature. In general, you can lower the oven temperature by 25 degrees Fahrenheit (about 15 degrees Celsius) and expect the cake to take a bit longer to bake. Keep a close eye on the cake during baking to prevent overcooking.Grease and flour the glass bowl: Just as you would with a regular baking pan, make sure to grease the inside of the glass bowl and dust it with flour. This will help prevent the cake from sticking to the sides and bottom.Use the right size of the glass bowl: Ensure that the glass bowl you use is appropriate for the cake recipe you're making. If the bowl is too small, the cake may overflow during baking. If it's too large, the cake may not rise properly.Consider the shape: Glass bowls may have a different shape compared to traditional baking pans. The shape of the bowl can affect how the cake bakes and rises, so keep this in mind when choosing your recipe.Avoid drastic temperature changes: When using glass in the oven, it's essential to avoid drastic temperature changes. For example, don't place a cold glass bowl directly into a preheated oven, as this can cause it to crack. Instead, let the bowl come to room temperature first.\nIf you follow these guidelines, you can successfully bake a cake in a glass bowl. However, if you're unsure about the specific bowl you have or the recipe you want to use, it's always a good idea to consult the manufacturer's guidelines or use a traditional metal baking pan to be safe.\n Read More….\n[LINKED_TEXT: Doon Memories: 100% Eggless BakeryDoon memories 100% Eggless Bakery, being a seven-year young bakery house, comes up with the most delicious stick jaws, caramel chocolates, and fudges in town.

    "question": "How dangerous is low iron?",
    "answer": "Iron deficiency occurs when there is an insufficient amount of iron in the body to meet its needs. Iron is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in various bodily functions. When a person has iron deficiency, it can lead to several consequences and symptoms, including:\nAnemia: Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia worldwide. Anemia occurs when there is a decreased number of red blood cells or a decreased amount of hemoglobin in the blood. Hemoglobin carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues. Iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, so when there is insufficient iron, the body may not produce enough healthy red blood cells, leading to anemia. Symptoms of anemia can include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, dizziness, and poor concentration.Reduced immune function: Iron is important for a healthy immune system. Iron deficiency can weaken the immune response, making individuals more susceptible to infections and illnesses.Impaired cognitive function: Iron deficiency has been associated with cognitive impairments, especially in children. It can affect learning ability, attention span, memory, and overall cognitive development.Fatigue and weakness: Iron is involved in the production of energy and the metabolism of nutrients. Insufficient iron levels can result in low energy levels, persistent fatigue, and general weakness.Pale skin and brittle nails: In severe cases of iron deficiency, the skin may become pale or have a yellowish tinge. Brittle or spoon-shaped nails (koilonychia) can also be a sign of iron deficiency.Restless legs syndrome: Iron deficiency has been linked to restless legs syndrome (RLS), a condition characterized by an uncomfortable urge to move the legs, often accompanied by unpleasant sensations.Pica: Some people with iron deficiency may develop a condition called pica, where they have cravings for non-food substances like ice, dirt, clay, or paper.\nIt's important to note that these symptoms can vary in severity depending on the extent of iron deficiency.\n"

    "question": "Why are Trinity/Collegiate/Brearley in NYC being as highly regarded as Exeter/Andover, given that there are relatively limited sports/arts facilities at those schools?",
    "answer": "Because for most people (especially in New York) who are looking at elite schools, their academic quality is infinitely more important than that of their sports facilities.\n As an example, Horace Mann is probably considered the top independent high school in NYC, but that has virtually nothing to do with its incredible physical facilities, and everything to do with the quality of its education.\n So in the case of Brearley, for example, the fact that it is a relatively tiny school with zero in the way of facilities, doesn’t mean much to anyone who is looking for possibly the single best academic girls’ education in the country.\n But although the above answer is technically accurate, underlying the question is something quite different; something that has really interesting overtones and undercurrents of culture, religion, class, parenting style and philosophy.\n The elite NYC high schools are all day schools; Exeter and Andover are both boarding schools. For a certain class of traditional, old-money, WASP families, it was (and to an extent still is) the absolute norm to send your teenage children off to boarding school. There they could develop their mind, body, and social skills in a safe environment of similar children. To those parents, having your child not go to a name-brand boarding school would immediately cause raised eyebrows among your peers. They might look at families whose children stayed at home and went to day schools [often with a large Jewish population] in the way that a Princetonian might look at someone attending City College.\n On the flip side, for a particular class of upper-middle income, intellectual/professional, second or third generation American, often Jewish, close-knit family, the idea of sending your children away at age 14 is about as comprehensible to them as giving them up for adoption to China.\n The perspectives really are that starkly different. Even today, when both sets of schools are much more heterogeneous in their student body demographics, each of the two family types regards the other with a certain combination of pity, disdain and superiority. It’s pretty funny to watch (if you’re attuned to this sort of thing).\n Exeter\nHorace Mann\nBrearley\n"

    "question": "Would spending $100 dollars a day or week on lottery tickets increase your odds at hitting the jackpot? Or are the odds so low that someone buying 1 ticket has the same chance essentially?",
    "answer": "The odds of winning Florida’s Lotto is 1 in 22,957,480. Drawings are held twice a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Let’s say you bought 100 tickets for every drawing. That’s 104 drawings, or 10,400 tickets, every year. If you did this starting on your 18th birthday and played until retirement at 65, that would be 488,800 tickets. That would give you a roughly 2% chance of winning one drawing.\n It’s not impossible to live to be 120. So, let’s say you buy 100 tickets for each drawing for 100 years. That’s just north of a million tickets. That puts you around 4.5%. Still not particularly impressive.\n It’s also a little deceptive. Each drawing is independent of all the others, meaning that you might win two or three times, assuming you keep playing. More than likely, though, you won’t win at all.\n Consider that if you stop when you retire, that would be 47 years of gambling. At $10,400 per year, you would have spent $488,800 on your tickets. Yes, you would get something back in winnings, either in the form of free tickets or small prizes. It probably won’t be enough to make that money back. You might want to consider putting that money in a bank/retirement account or buying stock.\n"

On top of that, the price can get really expensive because of how rare it is. Some meteorites will have different material compositions that are rarely found on earth.\n This determines the price of the meteorite.\n 5. Bur-Abor ($600,000-$800,000)\nThe rock which is known as Bur-Abor is a meteorite specimen found in Kenya in 1997. It was sold in Los Angeles in May 2021 at the Bonhams auction with a hefty price tag of $600,000 - $800,000.\n 4. Conception Junction ($775,299.24)\nThe Conception Junction meteorite was found in 2006 near the same city as its name with a population of only 202 people. One farmer found this rock buried under a mountain and finally brought it to an archeologist from Washington University, St Louis stating that the rock is rarely found and worth $750,000.\n 3. Brenham ($934,680.32)\nThe Brenham meteorite fell onto earth around 20,000 years ago and was found in Kiowa County, Kansas in 1882. This rock is another pallasite that is formed from metal rock. When cut, the pallasite exposes shiny olivin crystal(also known as peridot) that has been formed inside the rock.\n 2. Willamette ($1,100,000 - $1,300,000)\nThe Williamette Meteorite is a 15.5-tonne meteorite that is made from metal with a medium octahedrite configuration. This meteorite has a smooth touch on it since the surface melts as it enters our atmosphere.\n 1. Fukang ($1,773,593)\nIt was found in the year 2000 at the Fukand Mountain and is also a pallasite type meteorite made from metal rocks with the formation of olivin crystals or magnesium silicate.

    "question": "How is HTTPS any more secure than HTTP if literally anyone can implement it?",
    "answer": "The security of SSL rests on a foundation of four pillars.\nThe security of the protocols and ciphers. The details of these are all public information and are highly scrutinized by professionals in both the academic and commercial sectors.The security of the stacks that implement the protocols and ciphers. Most of these are open source and are subject to the same level of scrutiny as the underlying protocols and ciphers. The ones that aren’t are supported by companies that we (mostly) trust to have the expertise to design, implement and maintain this software. We should not, and do not, trust “literally anyone” to build these stacks.The security of the certificate authorities that issue the unique cryptographic certificates that every system that provides SSL connections rely on for their public and private keys. This is a potential weakpoint, but there have been relatively few breaches of CAs — as far as we know. The fact that there are many such CAs provides resilience for the overall SSL security ecosystem, as switching providers remedies any one breach. There are two important checks on who can implement a public CA that serves to increase our confidence in them. The first is simply the free market. People won’t patronize a public CA that isn’t trusted. The second is the major browser manufacturers, who will not distribute the public keys needed to validate certificates from a CA that they do not consider trustworthy. They can also invalidate certificates from any CA that is breached by pushing out an update to the browser.The security of the servers that are providing the SSL connections, and of the people who administer them. This is the weakest link. A properly managed server will always have at least one extra layer of passwords to get through in order to protect its certificates, and properly-trained administrators will never keep those passwords anywhere that could be accessible but administrators are humans and do make mistakes, and someone who has gained total control of a server can, in theory, and if they wait long enough, always get the password the next time it has to be typed in.\n"

Exiled from his native Epirus he fought in the Wars of the Diadochi, was captured by king Ptolemy but won the eye of the king, who supported his return to Epirus.\n Pinned to the wall, fighting for his life against his former master Demetrius, Pyrrhus won a battle by personally dueling and killing the enemy general. He then joined the alliance of Hellenistic kings against Demetrius and invaded and conquered Macedonia itself.\n Things went south: his ally Lysinachus turned against him and defeated him\n Pyrrhus was insatiable though; he promptly turned to Italy to save the Greek cities from Rome….And take then for his own.\n Like Hannibal himself he won battle after battle but couldn't overcome the superior numbers of Rome. Eventually one devastating defeat forced him to retreat\n He then tried to do the same in Sicily against Carthage: he was so successful the Sicilians and Carthaginians joined forces to defeat him.\n He returned to Greece and conquered Macedonia again, only stopped by a Spartan alliance with Macedon. His last battle was in Argos which he attacked as a fighting retreat. He died in desperate street fighting. Reportedly an Argive woman threw a roof tile, striking him in the neck and knocking him off his horse. A Macedonian mercenary then took his head\n"

    "answer": "First define the stoichiometry of the compounds\n Iron(II) sulfide = FeS\n Iron(III) oxide = Fe2O3\n sulfur dioxide = SO2\n [math]FeS + O_2 \\to Fe_2O_3 + SO_2[/math]\n That does not balance at all.

You can multiply or divide by anything as long as you treat everybody the same way.\n So you could easily write it for one mole of O2 by dividing everything by 3.5\n [math]2/3.5 : 1 :: 1/3.5 : 2/3.5[/math]\n But unfortunately, all this works only in moles. And you have grams. So you will first have to make moles out of that.\n For oxygen that would become 71.5 / 32 [g / g/mol] = 71.5/32 [mole] So we could now easily multiply everything by that number and find that way that we could produce 71.5/(32*3.5) moles of iron oxide.\n But wait, we do need twice as many moles (2*71.5)/(32*3.5) of FeS for that!\n Do we have that? Otherwise we would have to do the same trick for FeS rather than O2. Limiting reagent and all that.\n"

Authorhouse does not allow author-owned ISBNs. You must use theirs and that means they own the publishing rights as well. Whoever owns the ISBN, owns the publishing rights and, as Ron Pramschufer says, “If you don’t own the publishing rights, you don’t own squat.” Authorhouse allows its authors a 50% discount from retail price to print books for personal use. A 14$ book will cost the author 7$ to print. Lightning Source will print that same book for Authorhouse for 3 to 5$. Authorhouse charges the author 7$ and pockets the other 2 to 4$. A self-published author can open an account at Lightning Source, supply print-ready files and get the steep discount to print books just like Authorhouse or any of the other vanity publishers, bypassing them altogether.

    "answer": "It’s impossible to answer for Westerners as a whole. With that understood, there are two questions here:\n “Do Westerners find it strange that Eastern countries that are modernized in technology still have concepts of obedience to elders, family honor, social conformity and ancient tradition?”\n Not at all. Westerners often don’t understand Eastern cultures, but we do assume, without fail, that they value obedience, family honor, social conformity, and ancient tradition.\n This is not to say that we respect them for doing so, mind you, only that we understand that they value those. This is because most negative Western stereotypes about Asian cultures are built on the statement that Asian cultures value obedience, etc.\n What we don’t understand is this claim that India and Pakistan are “countries that are modernized in technology”. That claim is one many Westerners would reject automatically with disbelief, as neither country has the widespread technological infrastructure which is common in the US, Europe, Japan, Australia, China, etc.\n India and Pakistan, to Western perception, are rural and undeveloped, and in no way comparable, technologically, to either the West, or China, Japan, South Korea, or Singapore. It would be very difficult to find people in the West that consider India and Pakistan to be our technological equals.\n So, yes, we know that India and Pakistan value family honor, and that these values are different from our values. We do not accept that they are technologically advanced countries.\n"

    "question": "Can an F-15 fighter jet sink a ship with a smart bomb?",
    "answer": "Yes, an F-15 can surely sink a ship with a smart bomb. In fact, it has already been done although not in the way most would imagine. On April 28, 2022, an F-15E Strike Eagle dropped a smart bomb successfully destroying a full-scale surface ship in the Gulf of Mexico. It only took a single bomb to sink the ship.\nDuring World War II, torpedoes relied on a direct hit to damage a ship. The goal was to create a hole in the ship that caused flooding. As the ship began to list to the side and sink, the crew would have to divert their attention to flood control. The ship would lose speed, become less maneuverable, and could eventually capsize. It usually took many direct hits on a warship with watertight compartments to sink it although a lucky shot in the right place at the right time could do the job. The Japanese battleship Musashi took over 20 hits from air-dropped torpedoes before it sank.\nThe bomb that the F-15E used to sink a ship was pretty smart. It was guided alongside and underneath where it exploded without touching the ship. The explosion broke the back and sank the ship the same way a modern torpedo works.\nToday, the two most common anti-ship weapons are torpedoes and cruise missiles. Both weapons are precise and deadly, but incredibly expensive. The U.S. Air Force and Navy got together in the QUICKSINK program to develop inexpensive solutions to sinking surface ships.\nThe Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a bolt-on guidance kit that converts standard gravity bombs or \"dumb bombs\" into all-weather precision-guided munitions. JDAM bombs range from 500 to 2,000 pounds.\nAlthough the JDAM can be used to sink large civilian ships, it is not that easy to sink a warship packing air defense missiles. To sink a warship, all surface-to-air missiles in the area must be disabled before deploying JDAM bombs. Once disabled, the JDAM can make short work of enemy surface ships. Not an easy task, but with the technology that is emerging, air defense will be faced with new challenges.\nBelow is a video of the QUICKSINK test.\n"

    "question": "Isn't Mount Vesuvius an active volcano? Could the Vatican be doomed if there was a major eruption?",
    "answer": "It is indeed. Its last eruption lasted from 1913 to 1944 and it’s the only active volcano on the European mainland. 600,000 people live close enough to be killed instantly by a sudden pyroclastic flow event, and another 2.4 million live close enough to be in danger during a major eruption, including the entire city of Naples, which is only 9km away from the center of the mountain. Currently, it erupts about three times a century.\n But don’t worry about Vatican, it’s over 240 km away from the mountain. That’s close enough to get ashfall, but not lava or anything else dangerous. For the most part, when Vesuvius has erupted recently, it’s only emitted sulfur rich steam and little else. Mind you, when it does erupt, the eruption generally lasts an average of five years.\n So why do people risk it? Because the bigger ash eruptions bring up lots of plant friendly minerals from inside the earth like potassium and phosphorus. When the ash mixes with existing soil you get a very good environment for farming.\n"

    "question": "Do owners of racing cars (Lamborghini, Audi, Ferrari, Porsche etc) drive them around every day like when going for shopping or when going at work? Do they always have to watch their cars when parked in public to not get scratched/damaged by someone?",
    "answer": "Use your imagination, a supercar might be somewhat comfortable and refined, but with no rear seats, or a tiny trunk with limited usefulness, not to mention that visibility is a problem(as it is in any car that low), pretty bad fuel economy, and constant anxiety about leaving your supercar in a public parking lot - you realize it is not made for everyday driving.In the city, for example, the Countach, Diablo, and Murcielago drive/drove like one was wrestling a bull. The Aventador was tamer.\n The Ferraris design language is much more elegant and timeless than older lambos, but the problem is that in traffic or parkways, for you to put groceries or dry cleaning in, is nerve-wracking. This happens with most supercars, and not only Ferrari. Take the Audi R8, for example, you can't get even one golf bag behind the seats unless you're a midget or you're playing pitch and putt. Porsche have similar machines so they too have issues, but way more practical than a Ferrari or Lambo.\n No the owners of Lamborghini or Ferrari or any others outrageous supercar will not drive them every day, but supercars like Audi or Porsche are better choice for more frequent driving, but still less practical than a Golf GTI.\n"

    "question": "Why is MCU phase 4 looking so aimless and too divergent?",
    "answer": "There are also at least two different “agendas” going on in MCU Phase 4, completing unfinished character arcs and introducing new torchbearers and seeing how the audience reacts. Some of the Phase 4 shows combine both.\n The first is pretty clear, Thor, Loki, Spiderman, Wanda and Doctor Strange all had ongoing story arcs that were brought to conclusions (of sorts) in their Phase 4 movies and shows, Spiderman’s to rousing critical and fan acclaim.\nThe second mirrors Phase 1, where similarly disconnected movies and shows were presented, and audience/fan reaction gauged to determine which would become the torchbearers. Hulk was first, and the tepid response is why Hulk became just a comic relief/tank/side character during the Infinity War saga.\nRobert Downey’s Iron Man was a huge hit, as was Chris Evans’ Cap, so both got multiple solo sequels that began unrelated but were tied together first with cameos and post credit and mid credit scenes to the Avengers. If Iron Man had met the same response as Hulk, there wouldn’t have been two sequels and the character would not have been the pivotal arc of Infinity War.\nThe combo features gave us a new Black Widow, a new Hawkeye, a Ms Marvel, a She Hulk and a “new” Cap, introduced at the same time as completions of their predecessor heroes, and the brand new features gave us Moon Knight, Shang Chi and the Eternals. The reactions/popularity of those will likely determine which get featured in Phase 5 and 6, just like the reactions to the Phase 1 and 2 features determined who got to be the lead characters in Infinity War.\n"

    "question": "We know that a capacitor always blocks the DC, but in an oscillator it does not happen. Why?",
    "answer": "A capacitor is a passive electronic component that stores energy in an electric field. In a DC circuit, a capacitor blocks the flow of direct current (DC) by charging up to the source voltage and then preventing any further current flow. However, in an oscillator circuit, the capacitor is part of a feedback loop that allows alternating current (AC) to flow through the circuit, which in turn allows the oscillator to produce a continuous AC output.\n In an oscillator circuit, the capacitor is typically connected in parallel with an inductor to form a resonant LC circuit. When the oscillator is first turned on, the capacitor and inductor form a resonant circuit that allows AC to flow back and forth between them. As the AC current flows through the circuit, it charges and discharges the capacitor, causing the voltage across the capacitor to oscillate back and forth.\n The oscillation of the voltage across the capacitor, in turn, creates an oscillating voltage across the entire circuit, including the output of the oscillator. Because the capacitor is part of a resonant LC circuit, it is able to pass AC signals while still blocking DC signals, allowing the oscillator to produce a continuous AC output.\n In summary, in an oscillator circuit, the capacitor is part of a resonant feedback loop that allows AC to flow through the circuit, which in turn allows the oscillator to produce a continuous AC output. While the capacitor still blocks DC signals, it is able to pass AC signals because of its role in the resonant circuit.\n"

    "question": "Do I need geography for civil engineering?",
    "answer": "Yes, having a strong foundation in geography is beneficial for civil engineers and construction professionals. Geography provides essential knowledge and skills that contribute to the successful planning, design, and execution of construction projects.Firstly, geography helps civil engineers in site selection and land-use planning. Understanding topography, climatic conditions, and geological features of a region enables engineers to make informed decisions regarding the suitability of a location for construction projects. It helps them identify potential hazards, such as landslides, floods, or seismic activity, which may affect the safety and stability of structures.\n Furthermore, knowledge of geography aids in the efficient utilization of resources. By understanding the natural resources available in a specific area, civil engineers can design projects that minimize environmental impact and maximize sustainability. They can also take advantage of local materials, reducing costs and transportation requirements.\n Geography also plays a crucial role in infrastructure development. Civil engineers need to consider the existing transportation networks, water bodies, and urban development patterns when designing roads, bridges, and utility systems. This knowledge allows them to create infrastructure that integrates seamlessly with the surrounding environment, ensuring optimal functionality and accessibility.\n Additionally, understanding the economic and social geography of an area is vital for civil engineers and construction professionals. It helps them assess the demographic characteristics, population growth, and land-use patterns, which are essential for determining the infrastructure needs of a region. This knowledge enables engineers to design projects that cater to the specific requirements of the local community, fostering sustainable development.\n In conclusion, geography is a valuable asset for civil engineers and construction professionals. It equips them with the necessary knowledge and skills to make informed decisions, optimize resource utilization, and design infrastructure that aligns with the natural and social characteristics of a region. Incorporating geography into civil engineering education and practice can lead to more efficient and sustainable construction projects.\n"

    "question": "About cosmology, how many distant galaxies rounded to the nearest million, have astronomers actually seen disappear from the observable universe, as they are moving faster than light speed?",
    "answer": "No, that’s really not the way it works.\n Suppose you are following a distant galaxy in an accelerating universe. The galaxy is far enough away so that over the eons (many, many billions of years) its speed relative to us is gradually increasing.\n As a result, you would see that galaxy under increasing redshift, and consequently, everything that happens there will appear in slow motion. It will be harder and harder to observe, because of the increasing distance and increasing redshift (which also further reduces the intensity of its light). But suppose you could nonetheless follow that galaxy for a lot longer (we are now talking trillions of years or more.) The result? You would never see the galaxy disappear. Eventually, its luminosity may fall below the threshold of your instruments, but if your instruments could be improved, the galaxy would reappear. The moment when it would cross your cosmological event horizon remains forever in your future. (That is a common theme with event horizons; after all, they are things in spacetime, not space.)\n So if we had billions of years at our disposal, we would indeed see the accelerating recession of distant galaxies, but we would never see them cross that horizon.\n In reality, we have at most a few hundred years of astronomical observations, less than a hundred, really, when it comes to systematic observation of spectra of extragalactic objects. Way too short a time frame to see the acceleration directly. We deduce the acceleration by observing different objects at different distances and redshifts.\n"

    "question": "What are some ideas for a private school to fundraise for a gym?",
    "answer": "A gym is a very big project and one that will require you to travel to the exciting Land of Major Donors.  You'll definitely want to have a fundraising campaign for the gym which includes a lot of careful, behind-the-scenes work leading to one-on-one meetings between some combination of your school head, trustees, development director and your major donor prospects wherein the donor is asked for a significant gift.  Standard wisdom is that 80-90% of the funds will come from 10-20% of the donors.  It is also pretty standard that a project this large has arisen out of a thoughtful strategic planning process. \n This is not bake sale territory but you do want the campaign to become accessible to everyone once it is known to be a success.  When you have commitments for the bulk of the needed funds you can open up the campaign to the community to encourage everyone's involvement, and do something like sell square feet of the gym for $10 each.

    "question": "Why are modern Iranians lighter than ancient Iranians, when both are Persians?",
    "answer": "First of all the whole premise of this question is wrong and obtuse, secondly how do you know ancient Persians were dark or light? Have you traveled through time to 3000 years ago and observed them !? Thirdly who cares if someone's skin has lesser or more melanin in it?! Being white or dark is not an achievement nor it is a point to be proud of, it is a gnenetical thing, if a white Nordic man comes and lives in middle eastern climate for 4 generation his offspring can be darker than he was. So who cares?!\n Original Persians migrated from Sibera looking for warm waters and places to farm, they resettled in the Iranian plathue, nobody knows if they were white or brown or black, as far as we can say they were smart to dig canals and farm and create an empire, later on they might have been mixed with other tribes or races but when you look at it, we humans are all originated from sahara desert, we chose to migrate and spread in different continents but the climate decide the amount melanin in our skin, it doesn't make us smarter or dumber, what makes us dumber than others is the amount of prejudice, bias and racism we hold toward others for the color of their skin.\n"

    "question": "Is C-PTSD similar to BPD?",
    "answer": "There is a lot of debate surrounding the similarities and differences between c-PTSD and BPD. While there are some similarities, there are also some key differences. Here, we will explore both c-PTSD and BPD in order to better understand the similarities and differences between the two.\n C-PTSD is a form of PTSD that can develop after someone has been exposed to chronic trauma. This can include things like childhood abuse, domestic violence, or being in a war zone. C-PTSD can lead to a number of symptoms, including:\nFlashbacksNightmaressleep disturbancesintrusive thoughtsdifficulty concentratinghypervigilanceemotional numbingavoidance\nBPD is a mental illness that is characterized by a number of symptoms, including:\nimpulsivityself-harmrisky behaviorsintense mood swingsdifficulty regulating emotionsunstable relationships\nThere are some similarities between c-PTSD and BPD, such as the fact that both can lead to emotional numbing and avoidance. However, there are also some key differences. For example, BPD is characterized by impulsivity and self-harm, while c-PTSD is not. Additionally, c-PTSD is typically associated with exposure to chronic trauma, while BPD is not.\n"

    "answer": "Price.\n You can (or at least, recently could) go to the Russian company: [LINKED_TEXT: Space Adventures] [URL: http://www.spaceadventures.com/] and pay them tens of millions of dollars - and they’d fly you to the ISS for a 10 day orbital vacation.\n Around half a dozen people have already done exactly that - and one particularly rich guy did it twice already!\n So it is already “available” - it’s just a matter of price.\n Right now it’s costly because space flight is costly.\n The Russian Soyuz capsule can deliver cargo to orbit for about $20,000 per kilogram. So a human in a spacesuit - with enough food and water for 10 days is probably around 150kg - so the price is going to be AT LEAST $3 million. In practice it’ll be a lot more than that because $20,000 per kg doesn’t include the return trip and all of the training you’d need to be safely able to travel.\n The actual price charged for a 10 day trip is more like $20,000,000.\n So - ultimately - the need is to get that $20,000/kg down to a more reasonable number.\n If SpaceX’s BFR does what they claim - then they’ll cut that $20,000 down to just $75/kg…which suggests that maybe you could get yourself into orbit for $11,250…but probably, additional costs would push that up to $100,000.\n Still - that’s something that many people could afford. It’s not unprecidented for people to spend one year of salary on a “journey of a lifetime” vacation. So a LOT of people could afford a trip to space.\n Elon Musk has been talking about sub-orbital flights in the BFR coming down to about the price of a 1st class airfare.\n So it’s happening, gradually.\n What’s needed are cheap, reliable, re-usable spacecraft…and that’s happening right now!\n"

    "question": "Why don't small civil jets use high bypass turbofans?",
    "answer": "Small civil jets typically do not use high bypass turbofans for several reasons:\nCost: High bypass turbofans are more expensive than other types of jet engines. This makes them less practical for use in smaller civil jets, which are typically designed to be more affordable and cost-effective.Size: High bypass turbofans are typically larger and heavier than other types of jet engines. This makes them less suitable for use in smaller civil jets, which require lighter and more compact engines.Efficiency: High bypass turbofans are most efficient at high altitudes and high speeds. Smaller civil jets typically operate at lower altitudes and speeds, where other types of jet engines can be more efficient.Noise: High bypass turbofans produce less noise than other types of jet engines, but they are still relatively loud. This can be a concern in residential areas or near airports, where noise pollution is a significant issue.\nFor these reasons, smaller civil jets typically use other types of jet engines, such as turbojets or turbofans with lower bypass ratios, that are better suited to their size, operating conditions, and cost requirements.\n"

    "answer": "It’s not so much intellectuals should be protected as people with specialized skill sets need to be protected.\n Let’s take a look - suppose you have someone who is skilled at manufacturing operations, including managing Internet of Things on a manufacturing line. Sure, you could put a rifle in his hand and make him an infantryman. He’d probably be good at it. But.. who would run the manufacturing plant? Who else has the IoT skills to run the plant at maximum efficiency, turning the most goods at the least cost?\n Now… which is the more valuable skill? Yes, both are important. It takes a couple months to go to through boot camp. It takes years to properly learn mfg ops and another couple years to get the experience to manage the Internet of Things in a way that improves efficiency. There’s also a question of talent - if you don’t have it, no matter how much you train, you won’t be as good as someone who has talent.\n That’s not to say infantry are not valuable nor skilled - they are. It’s a skill that can be taught much quicker and requires less talent than the above job. So, yes, specialized skillsets should be utilized where they can be best utilized - which isn’t in the infantry.\n"

    "question": "How do liberals propose funding their nice programs when the US owes over 20 trillion dollars in public debt with over 100 trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities and a 688 billion dollar annual federal budget deficit?",
    "answer": "The US government does not have a debt of 20 or 22 trillion dollars. Local and foreign financial institutions own 22 trillion dollars in the form of treasury bonds and similar securities that are liquid assets and can be turned back into cash by selling the bonds in the secondary markets or redeemed for cash plus interest by the FED/Treasury upon maturity of the bond.\n Who does the US government have to repay when others already own these assets?\n US government deficits have been financed through currency issuance by the FED at no effective cost or interest expense. There is no US government debt but the states certainly do have debts. It has been this way since 1971 when Richard Nixon unpegged the US dollar from gold and it became a free floating fiat currency. The fact that treasury bonds are sold on a one to one basis corresponding to any federal deficits gives the illusion that bonds fund deficits but this has not been the case since 1971.\n Bond sales are actually used to remove excess reserves from the US banking system so as to maintain the target interest rate during overnight interbank lending but even here better alternatives exist for example maintaining a policy of a zero interest rate on bank reserves. Bond sales are currently part of monetary policy (interest rate control) and not fiscal policy as the sale of bonds in no way increases the spending capacity of the federal government.\n The fear campaigns about US government deficits and the federal debt are based on falsehoods and are used by corporate and commercial banking interests to convince politicians and citizens that government austerity must be imposed and to maintain a large pool of unemployed to help drive down labour costs.\n The reality is that optimal fiscal policy occurs when deficits are sufficient that the private and government sectors are able to deliver full employment. Deficits are nearly always necessary to achieve full employment but if ongoing inflation was trending above a target rate of 2% for example and shrinking the deficit was not sufficient to reduce inflation then a federal government surplus may then be necessary.\n Wall Street investment banker and self trained economist Warren Mosler’s short pdf book ‘The 7 deadly innocent frauds of economic policy’, available for free online explains the reality of national government finances and macroeconomics.\n [LINKED_TEXT: Mandatory Readings - The Center of the Universe] [URL: http://moslereconomics.com/mandatory-readings/]\n"

    "question": "How is the maximum energy of a circular proton accelerator (i.e. the LHC) related to its circumference?",
    "answer": "The aim of any proton accelerator is to, intuitively, accelerate protons to the highest velocity possible. Circular accelerators are useful in that you can re-use the circular track to build up proton velocities over a much longer distance than a single straight track.\n In order to use a circular accelerator in this way, you need to have magnets exerting a magnetic field on the accelerator ring. Charged particles bend when moving through a magnetic field (the Lorentz Force), and equating the Lorentz force to the centripetal force on an object moving in a circular path will give you the numbers and variable relationships necessary to produce a stable orbit:\n F = qvB = mv^2 / r\n There is no fundamental radius that an accelerator must have in order to be successful, but the choice of radius does affect how strong your magnets must be. Stronger and stronger magnets are required to constrain higher and higher velocity particles to the same radius.\n The choice of circular accelerator radius then becomes an engineering problem - is it easier to create more powerful magnets along the whole ring, or is it easier to build a larger ring?\n Building a whole new accelerator from scratch is very time- and labour-intensive, and a big commitment for any scientific collaboration. Once an accelerator is built it typically undergoes many magnet, geometry, and detector upgrades over a long time period to create as much value as possible from its initial investment.\n"

People donate recyclables in bulk all the time, and it’s probably the easiest, most eco-friendly way to separate yourself from them discreetly.\n Don’t offer up an explanation if nobody asks. To offer any sort of excuse implying you didn’t drink them all yourself is just inviting that very assumption. (Same goes when you buy it. Non-problem drinkers will plunk it on the counter; problem drinkers will volunteer that they’re “hosting a dinner party” or “having friends over” to the clerk ringing up their wine purchase.)\n If you only have a few, throw them in with your stuff (not together or they’ll clank). One in the gym bag, the other in your purse, and toss them into a public recycle bin.\n If you have no other choice and need to dump them in the trash, put the wine bottle into a sturdy paper bag and crush it with a hammer or rolling pin or rock. Then roll it up tight and stuff it in there, making sure the glass shards can’t easily escape.\n If it’s in the form of crushed glass, it’s not easily identifiable as a wine bottle.

    "question": "What are some examples of arguments against the existence of an afterlife?",
    "answer": "There are several arguments against the existence of an afterlife. Here are a few examples:\n 1. Lack of empirical evidence: Critics argue that there is no empirical evidence or scientific proof supporting the existence of an afterlife. Since the afterlife is often considered to be a realm beyond the physical world, it falls outside the scope of direct observation and measurement, making it difficult to provide empirical evidence for or against its existence.\n 2. Dependence on brain function: Skeptics suggest that consciousness and personal identity are intricately linked to brain function. According to this view, when the brain ceases to function at death, consciousness and personal experiences also come to an end, leaving no basis for an afterlife.\n 3. Inconsistencies among religious beliefs: Different cultures and religions have diverse and often contradictory beliefs about the afterlife. Critics argue that the wide range of beliefs and lack of consensus among religious traditions weaken the credibility of any specific afterlife claim. The existence of numerous conflicting accounts raises questions about the validity and objectivity of these beliefs.\n 4. Evolutionary and naturalistic explanations: From a naturalistic perspective, proponents argue that human beliefs in an afterlife may have evolved as psychological and sociocultural constructs. The concept of an afterlife could provide comfort, meaning, and moral guidance, contributing to the survival and cohesion of human societies.\n 5. Physicalist worldview: Some philosophical and scientific perspectives, such as philosophical materialism or physicalism, posit that everything, including consciousness and personal identity, can be explained by physical processes. From this viewpoint, there is no need to invoke supernatural or metaphysical explanations like an afterlife.\n It's important to note that these arguments do not definitively disprove the existence of an afterlife. They represent different perspectives that challenge the notion of an afterlife based on empirical evidence, philosophical reasoning, and alternative explanations. The question of whether an afterlife exists or not remains a deeply personal and philosophical matter, often influenced by individual beliefs, cultural backgrounds, and religious or spiritual traditions.\n"

    "answer": "Dinosaurs & dragons have been depicted accurately on petroglyphs, pottery, tapestries, stone carvings, cave drawings, burial stones, ceramic figures, wood cuts, metal etchings, paintings, tiles, and in written eye-witness accounts. They are described with precise physical accuracy long before science ‘discovered’ in the 1830s these “terrible lizards”. For example, a dragon is described breathing fire in Job 41:19, and a brontosaurus is depicted in Job 40:15 with a tail which would remind viewers of the cedars of Lebanon, similar to our Redwoods and Giant Sequoias. A tail like that isn’t found on a hippo or elephant! Today, one can find photos and videos of live dinosaurs like Mokele Mbembe.\n Leonardo Da Vinci (15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) painted a dinosaur (1517–18’) identified as the Lessemsauridae (in the prosauropods / sauropodomorphs category). On the same sheet of paper he depicts a cat and a lion (which he drew in an Italian zoo). All must have been drawn from direct observations for how could he have otherwise drawn a Lessemsauridae so anatomically accurate? [Royal Collection Trust / © Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2019]\n"

    "question": "How does critiquing help a reader (the one who critiques)?",
    "answer": "Excellent question. When critiquing, you are reading for more than pleasure or to learn something. It goes well beyond pointing out typos and misspellings, although those are important to note.\n Your goal is to help the author find what’s missing or wrong with their work so they can improve. As you learn to do that, you will find that you are able to read your own work and find many of your own mistakes in the same way.\n For example, you are reading and following the story. The author suddenly switches to another character’s point of view, and it stopped you cold. The next time you’re reading your own work, you may realize you did the same thing.\n Because critiquing someone else’s work is a big responsibility, take it seriously. If you’re not sure of a word’s spelling or meaning, look it up. Lots of people write the wrong word when two sound alike but have different meanings. Are there too many run-on sentences, and you felt as if you had to rush to keep up? What made the work easy or difficult to read? Sometimes you won’t know exactly what’s wrong, but you can convey that you got stuck at point A, or had to go back and reread several paragraphs before you could move on, etc.\n Do critiquing well, and you will develop better skills in grammar, sentence structure, and overall flow or writing as a result. When you focus on detecting mistakes, recognizing that something is missing, or knowing when the pace (or cadence or rhythm) of the story isn’t flowing well, you’ll become a better writer.\n One part of critiquing, too, is the importance of acknowledging when something is written well, the scene they just described was terrific, or you enjoyed how they made you feel the characters joy or pain through they way they wrote it.\n"

    "question": "How can I recognise fake Facebook profile?",
    "answer": "Here are some tips for finding the fake profiles on Facebook.\n Tip 1: Use Reverse image search to Identify the person in the profile picture:\n This is definitely the most accurate and fastest way of identifying fake Facebook accounts . How does reverse image search help you identify Fake Facebook accounts ? Reverse image search actually takes an image as a input and searches for similar images existing on the internet . It is pretty much like an search engine for images .\n Using reverse image search you can easily find out the real identity of the person in any profile picture . If the Facebook account is real then you will have a hard time finding out a similar photograph of the user on the internet .\n Tip 2: Most Fake Profiles always have a Single Image\n If the Facebook profile has less than one of his or her photo, then most probably it is an fake account. Most fake accounts tend to have a single profile picture.\n Tip 3: Check The users Timeline\n Find out when the user has joined Facebook, most fake accounts are created just less than a week before they start sending out rampant friend requests.\n Tip 4: Beware of Fake profiles of Girls\n Most fake profiles are created with an girls identity, which is why you should never accept friend requests from unknown females.\n Tip 5: Check the friend list\n Check out the friend list of the user. If a Fake Facebook account has many mutual friends with you, then chances are there that the Fake accounts is created by one of your friends who is trying to have some fun.\n Last but not the least , For the safety of yourself and others on Facebook do report the Fake Facebook accounts and request your friends to the same .\n Original Source: [LINKED_TEXT: Techverse.net : How-to Guides and Tips on Technology.] [URL: http://techverse.net/]\n"

    "question": "What made the Japanese think that kamikaze was a good idea?",
    "answer": "In an insane sort of way, it kind of was a logical idea.\n Japanese pilots were so poorly trained at this point (due to high losses, lack of fuel/aircraft for training) and American defenses strong (combat air patrol, ship screen deployment, proximity fuse anti-air fire) that it was unlikely they were going to score many hits. It’s also in a way, a waste of resources to train them super well just due to the superior American planes and pilots. They’re just too likely to die in a regular dogfight.\n Let’s say they can drop a bomb and hit a ship 8% of the time- even if they hit it’s possible Americans can control the damage. It’s also highly probable a pursuing fighter or some AA fire will take out the Japanese plane as it leaves. If they fly in and crash the plane directly into a ship- it doesn’t really matter if they take a hit on the way down or not. Let’s say 25% of these kamikaze runs are successful- that’s more than three times as effective and the aviation. fuel combined with ordinance carried would do a lot more damage than the bombs alone.\n Military History Visualized makes a great video on how it was “rational” for them to do this.\n"

    "answer": "That is a difficult question…\nthe US Constitution is very strong in its rights of the State; the Federal Government HAS NO POWER inside the borders of the State. This has been held up in many US Supreme Court (SCOTUS) cases.The Justice department will bloviate as the Federal does, when it has no power, in trying to get the uneducated to do things they legally have no need to; example of this is the COVID vaccine mandate which actually has never been designed, signed or made a regulation, Bill or Law by the federal government.They could make claim that the act of firearms being shipped from another State gives them the right to enact and enforce laws by way of the ‘interstate commerce’ in the US Constitution… but it will be easily disregarded due to the Bill of Rights 2nd and 10th Amendments overruling that very weak case.As well the State could just have armories produce and sell firearms within its borders.\nThe Federal has no power to actually enforce any rule, regulation or law in this regard.\n"

    "question": "Do soldiers only eat MREs when they are deployed or at a base?",
    "answer": "Do soldiers only eat MREs when they are deployed or at a base?\n No they do not. MREs are field rations, and fill the same role that C rations did in the past. While the two differ a lot the basic concept is still the same. The origin of the term C ration will explain the way the military handles rations. The term C ration came about just before World War II and was used until the 1980s.\n A rations were food cooked in the mess hall with mostly fresh ingredients.\n B rations were cooked in a field kitchen so they were mostly canned and dehydrated\n C rations were rations that the troops carried with them on their rucksack and prepared themselves with minimal equipment in the field.\n In the early 1980s, the C ration started to get replaced by the MRE and the military started eating dehydrated bagged meals out in the field. On base there is more to eat than rationed food.\n Military bases have on base stores. There are the exchange stores which can run in size from a small quickie mart to a large department store depending on the base. The large exchanges often have food courts and there are even snack bars.\n"

    "question": "When the dollar devalues to 1 euro = $2.50 or $3, will Americans then accept the US economy is weak? The dollar has been kept artificially high for decades and its not sustainable.",
    "answer": "First mistake: assuming, or presuming that the dollar “has been kept artificially high for decades.” Pull up a chart of DXY, the US Dollar Index. Global currency traders determine the relative value of most currencies, and DXY is typical, the dollar in relation to a basket of six other global currencies. The US as a country does nothing to influence the value of the dollar other than to be fiscally responsible. A long-term chart of the dollar will show when the US was, and was not responsible as the dollar declines during periods of irresponsibility and increases during periods of responsibility.\n A weak dollar is said “to be good for US exports,” but in reality the US imports far more products and goods than it exports, and most of its exports are farm products, weapons systems, and Boeing airplanes, so the “benefits” of a lower dollar are limited while the costs of a lower dollar in terms of the increased cost of imports like crude oil are spread across the whole of the economy, and they can be devastating. Not enough is ever said about how the crash in 2007 was a consequence of the falling dollar (lost 45% of its value) and the impact of quadrupling gas at the pump costs plus the increased cost of all energy to all industries and companies. A falling dollar is a calamity waiting to happen. Always.\n"

This was 43 times higher than the profit in the year-ago period.\n SpiceJet, which acquired 63 domestic and international slots of Jet, also posted its highest-ever quarterly profit in Q1FY20, after reporting a loss in the corresponding quarter of the last fiscal.\n Since the grounding of Jet, players like Indigo, SpiceJet have taken a front seat and are filling in the slots of Jet. Market share gain along with lower crude price has led to the improvement in their financial performance. Further, it would help players in gaining further market share leading to higher operating leverage as occupancy increases coupled with better passenger tariffs at competitive rates,\" said Ajit Mishra, Vice President, Research, Religare Broking.\n According to them, the benefits from Jet's demise have already played out and will no longer play a factor in the rise of Indian aviation.\n Jet's exit is actually bad news for Indian consumers as \"they have now a limited choice and little bargain on the price front.\"\n Source: Money Control\n"

    "question": "How come there are so many languages spoken in Iran, when it was once an ancient nation of Persia that spoke only one language (Middle-Persian)?",
    "answer": "“How come there are so many languages spoken in Iran, when it was once an ancient nation of Persia that spoke only one language (Middle-Persian)?”\n Well … there is a combination of things to consider here. First of all, the region that is now Iran was never home to only a single language. That is a myth. It’s just that the Persian language came to be dominant in the region.\n Something else to consider is that many of the languages of Iran are dialects of Persian: Standard Parisian (a.k.a Farsi), Kurdish, Galaki, Luri, etc. These languages did not all precisely descend from Middle Persian, but they were mutually intelligible with Middle Persian at that time.\n There have been other influences in Iran as well. The Arabs, of course, conquered Persia. This as well as Iran’s proximity to Iraq has meant that there have been lots of Arabic speakers in the region. The conquests of the Mongol Empire left Turkic speaking peoples in the region (because the Turks became part of the Mongol aristocracy). And then there are various other people from neighboring countries like Armenians and Georgians.\n"

Eventually you see the next possible step, and you can formulate the next question within that small field that can be answered with the tools you know exist with the money that you have, then you spent the time and effort to construct the experiment or study, get the data, analyze that data with established well-accepted procedures and conventions of your research community, connect it with prior research, and report it in the proper format, methods, and channels - namely journals.\n When you can do that once, which takes about 3–4 years of hard work, the scientific community deems that you now have enough experience to conduct real research on your own. You can be trusted with large sums of money to perform research without as much supervision.\n That is what a PhD, in any subject, really means - that you’ve earned the trust of your peers to conduct good research in your field of interest, and that they can have some measure of confidence in your work.\n A PhD. has nothing to do with being a “world expert”.

    "question": "What exact race are Assyrians?",
    "answer": "Assyrians are an ethnic group indigenous to the Middle East, with a long and rich history dating back thousands of years. They are a distinct ethnic group with their own unique culture, language, and traditions, and are often identified as a distinct religious minority in the region.\n The Assyrian people trace their origins back to the ancient Assyrian civilization, which was centered in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) and existed from around 2500 BCE to 609 BCE. The Assyrians have a complex ethnic and cultural identity, which has been shaped by centuries of migration, conquest, and assimilation.\n Today, the majority of Assyrians live in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and Iran. They are primarily Christian, belonging to various denominations such as the Assyrian Church of the East, the Chaldean Catholic Church, and the Syriac Orthodox Church. However, there are also significant Assyrian communities in the diaspora, particularly in the United States, Canada, and Europe.\n [LINKED_TEXT: If you want to know more about Assyrian Empire then you can read this book.] [URL: https://amzn.to/3HfOQCE]\n"

    "question": "What is the difference between the Opera GX web browser and the regular Opera web browser?",
    "answer": "Opera GX is a specialized version of the Opera web browser that is specifically designed for gamers. It includes features such as a built-in task manager that allows users to monitor and control the system resources used by the browser, as well as a \"GX Corner\" that provides updates on gaming-related news and deals.\n One of the main differences between Opera GX and the regular Opera browser is that Opera GX includes a \"GX Control\" feature that allows users to set limits on the amount of system resources (such as CPU and RAM usage) that the browser can use. This can help to prevent the browser from using too many resources and affecting the performance of other applications, such as games.\n Another difference is the design, Opera GX has a dark theme and a customizable sidebar that provides quick access to popular gaming sites, social media, and messaging apps. It also has a built-in Twitch integration, which allows users to watch live streams and interact with other viewers directly from the browser. Additionally, Opera GX has a unique feature called \"GX Sound\", that allows users to choose between different sound effects that will play when opening a new tab or closing a tab.\n Opera GX also has all the features that regular Opera browser has, such as VPN, ad-blocker, battery saver and other features that Opera browser is known for.\n In summary, the main difference between Opera GX and the regular Opera browser is that Opera GX is designed specifically for gamers, and includes features such as the ability to set limits on system resource usage and built-in Twitch integration.\n"

    "question": "Can you put magnets on an electric meter to slow it down?",
    "answer": "The best way to slow down your electric meter is to not slow it down at all in the first place. Never tamper with the electric meter.\n The electric meter is a property of the electric company and not your personal private property.\n NEVER DO THAT. IT IS ILLEGAL AND CAN ATTRACT SEVERE FINES OR IMPRISONMENT OR BOTH.\n When an electrical meter is bypassed, then it can no longer record the amount of electricity consumed. When the meter cannot show any readings, then it will not be possible for the electricity company to produce your electricity bills and take payments for the same.\n Bypassing a meter with an intention to use electricity free of cost is a serious crime and should not be done at all.\n If there is a genuine problem with the electricity meter, then contact the power company and ask them to rectify the problem.\n Besides, if you feel that the power consumption is very high and the high electricity bills are not affordable, then find ways to cut down on electricity consumption.\n Some methods include:\nUsing Solar Photo Voltaic equipment.Using BLDC Motor Fans.Using LED Lighting.Using LED Screens.\nThese methods will help save power in the long run. The amount of money invested on these appliances will be returned to you as you pay lesser on your electricity bills and save up money ultimately adding up and getting to the same amount as the one spent on the appliances.\n"

    "question": "What kind of experimental design is used to measure placebo effect?",
    "answer": "The experimental design to measure placebo effect is trivial to the point of nonsense.\n When a clinical study has a placebo-arm, all improvements on the placebo arm of the study that CANNOT be explained are considered placebo effects.\n If an improvement can be explained, like the natural course and forces if healing, then it's not placebo effect. If it is found that some other factors caused some improvements on the placebo arm, then those improvements are not placebo effects — they were caused by the cause.\n Any and all UNEXPLAINED improvements are classed as placebo effects.\n What about cures? There are no such things as placebo cures. Placebo cures are not in the dictionary, not in the medical dictionaries. Most clinical studies do not define cured and therefore cannot test for cured. However, if a cure does occur on the placebo arm in a study that does measure cures, those cures are considered to be natural, not “placebo effects\".\n Placebo effects cannot be investigated as to cause, because if a cause is found, it can be manipulated to produce the effect (intentionally or accidentally) so it's a real effect not a placebo effects.\n Placebo effects, in reality, are ignorance effects. They only exist when we don't understand the cause. If we ignore the cause, they continue to exist. If we find the cause, they disappear.\n To your health, tracy\n Author: The Science of Cure\n"

    "question": "If a child is bullied in school by another child, can the victim's parents file a police report?",
    "answer": "If your child is physically assaulted, no matter where, that is assault and battery. It is a police matter. The child should always tell parents, and the parents should report the incident to the police. Even if your child fought to defend himself. He has the right to do that. Schools do not protect children from bullies, so you must get the matter before the police.\n Do not trust a school to solve a physical bullying problem. They tend to punish both the innocent and the guilty when a student defends himself physically. And the punishment of the bully is usually not effective. Report the assault to the police, each time it happens, with evidence: date, time, location, witnesses, photos of physical injuries, doctor’s reports if needed.\n If necessary, also go to the principal, and if there is no appropriate response, send a letter to the school board, and consider hiring a lawyer if the school is still not responsive. Your school has custody of your child during school, an in transit to home, and is responsible for their safety. Failure to perform that duty is grounds to sue for damages, or in the worst case, might be criminal.\n"

This could involve having more energy, being healthier, and looking younger.\n Life experience and wisdom: Experience and wisdom frequently increase with age.

It might provide people more time to work toward their individual objectives and goals.\n Acceptance and fulfillment: Accepting one's current age can help one feel comfortable and fulfilled.

    "answer": "The movie “300” is just a fictional and unrealistic movie. You should read historical books. Persian empire (Achaemenid) is the first true empire of the world, which covered a vast area, encompassing one third people of that time.\n In fact, one shouldn’t compare Persian Empire with Greek states. They weren’t considered even a rival. However, Greeks established an Empire later, but at that time, they were small states fighting each other. Persian Empire also hadn’t any interest to invade there, because it already ruled the most rich nations and had captured greek states in Anatolia. The west Greece was geographically difficult to capture, with warrior and rebellious people. But sometimes west greeks attacked some cities in Persian Empire, causing some conflicts ([LINKED_TEXT: Greco-Persian Wars | 492-449 BC] [URL: https://www.britannica.com/event/Greco-Persian-Wars]),\n The berber was used by greeks for foreigners, and if they meant any other meaning, then they were wrong, because most nations in the Persian Empire, like Egypt, Babylonia, Phoenicia, … , were rich and civilized nations. Also Persians were very tolerant kings, who could establish and manage such a big empire.

    "question": "Does Canada feel animosity towards the Trump administration for the threats and tariffs of the last two years?",
    "answer": "And if they do?\n NAFTA, which as originally negotiated put the U.S. at a tremendous trade disadvantage compared to Mexico and Canada, was long since due to be renegotiated. USMCA has repaired those problems, for the most part, which will lead to revitalized trade between our countries — a good thing for all three countries.\n Certainly trade negotiations are trying, but they are a necessary part of doing business in the modern world, and most likely will not be renegotiated for decades.\n As to the higher tariffs for steel and aluminum imposed on every country, President Trump was clear that he was forced to impose these because, due to dumping, the U.S. domestic industries for these strategic metals were on the verge of bankruptcy.\n Canadian companies, as well as Mexican ones, were known to have allowed the Chinese to ship steel produced in China into their country, then relabel it as domestically produced and sold it to the U.S. at the lower tariff rate Canadian steel received as a result of NAFTA.\n This (highly illegal) trade practice was damaging to our domestic steel and aluminum producing companies by forcing them to compete price-wise with China’s subsidized steel production.\n Anyone at all aware of the importance of strong domestic sources of supply in strategic metals would understand that Trump’s reason for imposing these tariffs, and the reason American law allows him to do so without involving Congress, is that our defense spending budget had increased dramatically, and we needed to revive our domestic industries.\n Due to the way our military was depleted during the Obama administration, our military needed everything, from new ships, fighter jets and weapons systems to spare parts inventories.\n If Canadians resent that necessity, they should remember that Canada has long benefitted from the strong U.S. military, which has allowed them to spend less on defense because they are shielded from the threat of attack by their proximity to, and relationship with, the U.S.\n"

    "question": "Should record-keeping be required on all ammunition sales in the USA?",
    "answer": "It's been tried. It was a total, miserable failure that contributed zero to crime prevention and so unduly burdened both gun owners and ammunition sellers that the Federal regulations mandating it were repealed.\n The Gun Control Act (GCA) of 1968 required federal licensing for all firearm and ammunition sellers, plus required that logs be kept on all handgun ammunition sales. Then as now, the number of crimes involving rifles and shotguns (and their ammo) were so few that legislators saw no value in tracking their ammunition. Nonetheless, the handgun ammo provisions soon proved to be both burdensome and useless.\n By 1984, the Senate Judiciary Committee concluded that ammunition records were “not necessary to facilitate legitimate Federal law enforcement interests.\" Two years later, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) agreed, stating that then “current recordkeeping requirements for ammunition have no substantial law enforcement value.\"\n The Firearms Owners Protection Act of 1986 finally repealed the GCA ammunition record requirements. They had been shown over the previous 17+ years to be worse than useless.\n"

Use lifting devices, when available, to help you lift loads. Try to alternate physically demanding tasks with less demanding ones. If you work at a computer, make sure that your monitor, keyboard, mouse and chair are positioned properly. If you frequently talk on the phone and type or write at the same time, place your phone on speaker or use a headset. Avoid unnecessary bending, twisting and reaching.

    "question": "Why did the IMF loan money to Greece in the first place?",
    "answer": "That was a commonly known technique used in the 1980s during the Latin American debt crisis – that would allow Greece to avoid a payment default a month later on debt owed to European creditors. The reprieve also gave the IMF and its European partners time to sort out their technical differences on the struggling country’s growth and budget outlook. But the fund’s elegant compromise still left Greece under the shadow of an enormous debt overhang; reducing it, required Europe to find a way to set aside national politics and act on the basis of economic logic and necessity.\n For those of us who have been following the Greek economic tragedy for many years, much of the European view continues to defy economic logic – and for a simple reason: European politicians always worry about the domestic political consequences of the Greece debt, specially Germany. Hince, offering debt relief was believed to alleviate and defuse the geopolitical risks to undermine the credibility of governing parties that could provide a boost to extremist movements.\n Voilà!\n"

Maybe you’re hoping there’s some sort of mystical moment when you should buy a ticket, when the planets and stars happen to be at a certain visible location, or have a mystical consultant place a “winning spell” for you, or whatever. Well, no, there is no “special” time, lottery tickets are always going to have the same random odds, no matter when they’re bought.\n Yes, you can find all sorts of promotional websites and videos claiming to have “secret” formulae or insider information about how to win lotteries. The only winners in that scenario are the vendors who can attract customers gullible enough to believe such fake BS. Maybe you should ask yourself, if their secret formulae and all that worked so well, why do they have to bother selling any this, they could just win the lotteries themselves. They never seem to have an answer for that . . .\n Try to grasp this concept if you can, lotteries are in the business of making money, not giving it away to someone that happened to buy a ticket at the “right” time.

    "question": "Why don't the newer Jokers copy the design for Heath Ledger's Joker?",
    "answer": "That would be pointlessly derivative. Ledger’s Joker was compelling because it put a unique spin on the character while staying true to several of his core traits and principles. The Nolan Batman films attempt to be somewhat more believable than previous iterations of the franchise. Yes there are many impossible elements but there’s no magic, no super powers, Batman doesn’t go to outer space or build his own robotic power suit.\n In this more gritty down to Earth story it made sense for the Joker to be different. First and foremost falling into a vat of chemicals is entirely too pulpy. Alan Moore’s “The Killing Joke”, the primary inspiration for the Ledger Joker, retained this element of the character’s traditional backstory yet simultaneously made it unnecessary.\n In The Killing Joke the Joker became who he is because of trauma. From a psychological perspective we might say his apparent madness is his own defense mechanism against the pain he experienced. From a philosophical one we could propose that he had an existential “encounter with the absurd” and that really he’s not insane at all but is consciously choosing his world view in response to the apparent meaninglessness of life. Neither interpretation is aided by the idea that a bunch of make-believe chemicals scrambled his brains.\n Rejecting the chemical plant backstory informed the character’s appearance. It makes far more sense to dispense with the idea that he has bleached skin and a face paralyzed into a permanent smile and instead introduce something that pays homage to these elements in a more plausible way, thus his scars were born and he was relegated to simply painting his face. Likewise the Joker’s typically well-kempt appearance made little sense. Where would he go to get a haircut?\n For all these reasons it doesn’t make sense to create a Ledger style Joker in a more comic-book centric story. The Ledger Joker fits the Nolan world perfectly, but there are many others where he wouldn’t fit at all.\n"

    "question": "Why do I love Lord Vishnu so much? I am not a Hindu.",
    "answer": "Firstly, you don't have to be a Hindu to love Lord Vishnu.\n The greatness of Lord Vishnu is that, anyone can fall in love with Him irrespective of any religion, age, caste or creed, since His charisma is such.\n Vishnu is so beautiful with lotus shaped eyes, His mesmerizing smile, His body is as blue as sky, to tell in one word, Lord Vishnu is Manoharudu, who steals our hearts with His beauty.\nNo words or poetry exists in this world to describe His beauty !\n He rests on the Seshanag, is portrayed with four arms, resembling the four directions, and He is the protector and operator of this Universe. A lotus sprouts from His navel, from which lord Brahma, the creator is born.\n He has goddess Lakshmi, the prosperity provider to all the people as His wife and she resides in Vishnu's heart( Vakshasthala_stitayai). She presses His lotus feet and provides Him the much needed relief from the busy schedule as the Protector of the entire Universe.\nLord Vishnu is beautiful in and out, He is called the Bhaktha_vatsala ( Vatsalyamu means affection) since He has the utmost love towards His devotees and saves them in their dire need.\n So falling in love with Lord Vishnu is inevitable, surrender to His lotus feet and He will help you to sail this ocean called life ( bhava_sagaram) smoothly.\nOm Namo Narayanaya\n Om Bhakta_vatsalaya namaha\n Om Venkateshaya Namaha\n"

    "answer": "Very. Anything metallic or conductive, from Christmas tree tinsel, to a fork, to a baby’s finger, can burn your house down (and wreck the baby’s day).\n You see, if something completes the circuit, what you have is a small space heater. It creates an arc, that will very quickly heat up the wires.\n If you’re lucky, the circuit breaker will trip, but think about all that heat coming out of a blow drier. What if that heat was, instead, right next to some paper, and concentrated in a section an eighth of an inch wide? That might NOT pop the circuit breaker … after all, the blow drier didn’t (although it is close to the max, depending on the dryer). It all depends on resistance of the wires.\n Don’t gamble with your house and your life that way.\n Just because it creates a short circuit doesn’t mean the circuit breaker will pop (although they usually do, which is why they are a good idea).\n Yes, it’s a long shot, but not THAT long of a long shot:\n Electrical failures or malfunctions were the second leading cause of U.S. home fires in 2012-2016 (behind fires caused by unattended equipment), accounting for 13% of home structure fires.\nFires involving electrical failures or malfunctions accounted for the highest share of civilian deaths (18%) and direct property damage (20%).Nearly two of five fires (39%) involving electrical failure or malfunction occurred in the cold weather months from November through February.Arcing was the heat source in approximately three of five home fires involving an electrical failure or malfunction.\nEmphasis mine.

    "question": "I’m doing some restoration work on an old barn. The barn used to be red colored. Is there a specific barn red color that was used in the early 1900s? Why did they use red anyway?",
    "answer": "Initially they didn’t paint the barns at all. And the wood deteriorated.\n However, farmers didn’t have a lot of money for paint, but if they had cows, they had milk. So they could use a mixture of skimmed milk, lime, and iron oxide. Iron oxide has the advantage of being a fungicide, and if you have a wooden building that’s going to be subject to rain and snow and moisture, you’re definitely going to get mildew and fungus.\n And since iron oxide is rust, when that mix dried, it was a kind of reddish color.\n Eventually farmers found out that adding a little linseed oil made it even better, forming a plastic-like coating that lasted for a long time, which is why you still see some old red barns today.\n Milk was actually a common component in paint. The casein from milk acts as a binder in paint and people have been using it for that purpose for centuries. In the late 1700s, early 1800s, they figured out that adding finely ground chalk and a few other compounds produced a cheap and durable paint. Other recipes used other ingredients, such as one that used water, rye flour, linseed oil and tailings from copper mines.\n"

    "question": "What are the various elements used in the screen printing of consumer buying and product selling?",
    "answer": "A consumer’s buying decision depends on the type of products that they need to buy. The behavior of a consumer while buying a coffee is a lot different while buying a car.\n Based on observations, it is clear that purchases that are more complex and expensive involve higher deliberation and many more participants.\n Consumer buying behavior is determined by the level of involvement that a consumer shows towards a purchase decision. The amount of risk involved in a purchase also determines the buying behavior. Higher priced goods tend to high higher risk, thereby seeking higher involvement in buying decisions.\n Complex buying behavior is encountered particularly when consumers are buying an expensive product. In this infrequent transaction, consumers are highly involved in the purchase decision. Consumers will research thoroughly before committing to invest.\n Consumer behaves very different when buying an expensive product or a product that is unfamiliar to him. When the risk of buying a product is very high, a consumer consults friends, family and experts before making the decision.\n For example, when a consumer is buying a car for the first time, it’s a big decision as it involves high economic risk. There is a lot of thought on how it looks, how his friends and family will react, how will his social status change after buying the car, and so on.\n In complex buying behavior, the buyer will pass through a learning process. He will first develop beliefs about the product, then attitudes, and then making a thoughtful purchase choice.\n For complex buying behavior customers, marketers should have a deep understanding of the products. It is expected that they help the consumer to understand about their product. It is important to create advertising message in a way that influences the buyer’s beliefs and attitudes.\n"

    "question": "Why are Democrats afraid of Christians?",
    "answer": "The issue isn’t Christians, its theocracy. People can believe in whatever deities they wish and appeal to them as they feel the need. However, when people insist that their religious beliefs and practices become the law of the land, the result is always, yes ALWAYS, a reduction in freedom, ignoring of civil rights and, if allowed to progress, executions for non-crimes such as blasphemy.\n Mind you, it does not matter what religion one is talking about. They all become basically the same once they assume political power. In the USA it is Christians who are making the greatest effort to turn their religion into law, and who are in the best position to do so. We are reminded of that every time a Christian fanatic declares “the USA is a Christian nation!”\n Also consider that this applies to atheism. A state which actively promotes atheism as superior to theism is not better than a theocracy. The only way to preserve human rights and dignity is for the state to remain secular, that is for the state to officially declare religion to be a personal, not a political matter.\n"

Look at those two big rocky planets!”, not knowing that Venus is just about the most inhospitable place in this solar system, barring the sun. Another point to make is this - you would NOT have wanted to love on this planet 3 billion years ago; Earth was not very friendly at the time.\n The same thing could be the case at Tau Ceti. The planets may all be in a similar state to Venus. Maybe they are geologically dead. Maybe they have no water. Maybe they have superstorms. Maybe they lack an atmosphere. Maybe the rate of rotation is so slow that one half is a hellish desert and the other side a block of ice. Maybe they get pelted with asteroids ever year. Maybe the atmosphere is highly acidic. Maybe the barometric pressure is off the scale high.\n Just because a planet ticks off three boxes that suggest it may be earth-like, don't forget that there are a million boxes that needed checking for us to evolve on here.\n Peace\n"

    "question": "Could the models that promoted Fyre Festival face any legal consequences for their actions?",
    "answer": "Models such as Bella Hadid, Kendall Jenner, and Hailey Bieber, all promoted Fyre Festival through things like posting on social media. However, Fyre Festival turned out to be a scam, giving out 2 slices of bread and a piece of cheese for dinner instead of the promised gourmet dinners. These models are all facing legal consequences for their actions of promoting FF. They may all receive subpoenas to appear in court through their modeling agencies.\n On Monday, a judge allowed the companies representing the high profile models to be subpoenaed - which means they might have to reveal the payment documents made by Fyre’s organizer, Billy McFarland (who is currently in prison serving a 6-year sentence for his part in the fraud).\n The ruling is part of a wider investigation into how McFarland received $26 million in investor funding before the festival, $5.2 million of which was paid out to the models to participate in promotional activity, because the funds have gone “missing”.\n Example: Kendall Jenner made $275k in January 2017 to promote Fyre Fest on Instagram and draw attention to the artists from Kanye West's record label who were billed to appear.\n"

    "question": "Are scaffolding considered as a truss/frame?",
    "answer": "Scaffolding and trusses/frames are two different types of structures that serve different purposes.\n Scaffolding is a temporary structure used to support workers and materials during construction or maintenance work. It typically consists of a series of platforms, boards, and poles that are assembled to create a stable work surface at a height. [LINKED_TEXT: scaffolding queensland] [URL: https://ringally.com.au/] is designed to be easily erected and dismantled, and it is not typically designed to carry heavy loads or support structures.\n On the other hand, a truss or frame is a structural system that is designed to support heavy loads and provide stability. It typically consists of a series of interconnected triangles that distribute the load evenly across the structure. Trusses and frames are commonly used in the construction of buildings, bridges, and other large structures.\n While there may be some similarities between scaffolding and trusses/frames in terms of their construction and design, they are fundamentally different types of structures with different purposes. Therefore, scaffolding is not considered a truss/frame.\n Ring Ally is a reputable company that provides high-quality upright scaffolding rental services in Queensland, Australia. They have been in the industry for several years, and their experience and expertise have made them a reliable choice for anyone in need of [LINKED_TEXT: aluminum scaffolding queensland] [URL: https://ringally.com.au/mobile-scaffolds/].\n One of the main benefits of working with Ring Ally is their commitment to providing high-quality [LINKED_TEXT: aluminum scaffolding queensland] [URL: https://ringally.com.au/mobile-scaffolds/].

    "question": "What are the scope for civil engineering in foreign countries?",
    "answer": "The scope for civil engineering in foreign countries is vast and promising for construction professionals and civil engineers. With the rapid growth in infrastructure development and urbanization around the world, there is a high demand for skilled civil engineers in various countries.One of the key advantages of pursuing a career in civil engineering abroad is the opportunity to work on large-scale projects that may not be available in one's home country. Many foreign countries are investing heavily in their infrastructure, including the construction of bridges, highways, airports, and skyscrapers. This creates a significant need for civil engineers who can effectively design, plan, and manage these projects.\n Moreover, working in foreign countries can provide civil engineers with exposure to different construction techniques, technologies, and regulations. This can enhance their skills and knowledge, making them more versatile and adaptable professionals. It also allows for the exchange of ideas and best practices, fostering innovation and creativity in the field of civil engineering.\n In terms of career growth and opportunities, foreign countries often offer higher salaries and better benefits for civil engineers compared to their home countries. This, coupled with the chance to work on prestigious projects, can significantly boost one's professional profile and open doors to further career advancements.\n However, it is important to note that working in foreign countries may come with its own set of challenges, such as adapting to different cultures, languages, and working environments. It is crucial for civil engineers to be open-minded, flexible, and willing to learn in order to succeed in foreign markets.\n In conclusion, the scope for civil engineering in foreign countries is extensive and promising for construction professionals and civil engineers. It offers opportunities to work on large-scale projects, gain exposure to new technologies and regulations, and enjoy better career prospects. Pursuing a career in civil engineering abroad can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience for those willing to embrace new challenges and expand their horizons.\n"

    "question": "Why were U.S. citizen children of undocumented immigrants again left out of the stimulus package?",
    "answer": "“Why were U.S. citizen children of undocumented immigrants again left out of the stimulus package?”\n This question is based on a false premise.\n According to the United States Department of Homeland Security, United States Customs and Border Protection ([LINKED_TEXT: Requirements for Immigrant and Nonimmigrant Visas] [URL: https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/visa-waiver-program/requirements-immigrant-and-nonimmigrant-visas]), there is only one way to become an immigrant in the USA. A person that intends to immigrate must apply for and be granted an “Immigrant Visa”. Being granted an “Immigrant Visa” gives a person “Permanent Residence” status. Once they complete that process, they are, by definition, both “legal” and “documented”; unless and until they complete that process, they are not an “immigrant” (at best, they are an “intending immigrant”).\n Another phrase for “immigrant” is “Lawful Permanent Resident”. There is no way to be an “illegal Lawful Permanent Resident” or an “undocumented Lawful Permanent Resident”.\n The phrase “undocumented immigrant” is a self-nullifying oxymoron which attempts to describe a person that does not, and cannot, exist. It’s as wrong as calling someone an “uncivilized gentleman”.\n If an “undocumented immigrant” cannot exist, there is no way they can have children, citizens or not, and there’s no way that the non-existent children could be included in the stimulus package.\n"

    "question": "What happens if a person who orders pizza takes the pizza and refuses to pay?",
    "answer": "It's no doubt that many consume this dish all across America and its popularity is amazing. Some people spend their past time eating and they always prefer pizza. Due to its popularity there is competition in shops selling this dish and thus they've come up with different ways of promotion. Delivering pizza to habitual buyers also known as pizza delivery is one way.\n The story behind this process and how it started is quite interesting. In the U.S, it dates back to the second world war. Many American soldiers who fought the war in Italy, started shops known as pizzerias in America after the war. In Europe, history has it that Italians who migrated to countries like Holland, Germany & Belgium in the northern side of Europe started pizzerias in large scale between 1950 and 1960. This resulted to many hotels and restaurants in Europe that offer pizza delivery to customers.\n Domino's pizza is a good example of a shop that gives delivery services. In fact a few decades ago, they would complete the delivery within 30 minutes. However, due to road accidents by fast drivers, the pizza boy now does not give the actual time but he's always in good time. Generally, complains against shops is that they're far from delivery range and tend not to deliver to people with low income so as to supposedly keep away from unsafe areas.\n Pizza is delivered in a square box made of card board and with a logo of the company. There are also hot bags used which make sure the dish remains hot and fresh. These bags are made of vinyl, cordura and nylon. Pizza delivery to customers is a growing trend in many shops and it's normally free of charge.\n Pizzoli's Pizzeria- Pizza Delivery DC\n 1418 12th St NW, Washington, DC 20005, United States\n +1 202-234-3333\n [LINKED_TEXT: best pizza in dc] [URL: https://www.google.com/maps?cid=11482393623891808549]\n[LINKED_TEXT: Pizzoli's PizzeriaPizzoli's Pizzeria offers New York style pizza and are creatively designed on a delicious organic whole wheat flour crust, and hearth-baked to perfection.

    "question": "Why do planes sometimes leave a vapour trail behind them and sometimes not?",
    "answer": "These trails are actually called contrails, short for “condensation trails”  they are formed when the water in jet exhaust mixes with wet cold air, and condenses and freezes into ice crystals.  Contrails are actually a type of cirrus cloud.  When the air is wet and cold enough the trails can stay around for a long time, and sometimes spread out, wet and cold air depends on altitude.\n Now there are three reasons why some planes leave trails and some nearby planes do not:1 - That different planes have different engines.  Some engines will leave a contrail in air where another engine will not.  Here, for example are an Airbus A340 (maiden flight: 1991), leaving contrails, and a Boeing 707 (maiden flight: 1957)not leaving contrails however both are flying at 33,000 feet2 - The planes are at different altitudes3 - Wet and dry air can exist within a few feet of each planes (Source from) More information can be found at: [LINKED_TEXT: Why do some planes leave long trails, but others don't? - Contrail Science] [URL: http://contrailscience.com/why-do-some-planes-leave-long-trails-but-others-dont/]\n"

    "question": "My son gets a slip home every day from his teacher that needs to be signed because he gets in trouble. Should I sit in on his class for a day?",
    "answer": "Dear Friend:\n As a parent, we must understand that when it comes to our child's education, there are three parties involved: the teacher, the parent and the child.\n You should always feel free to sit in on your child's classroom regardless of what's happening. However, your child isn't sitting in a corner for no reason and there are two sides to every story.\n During the school day, the teachers and administrators have “legal custody” over your child and probably 25 to 30 others in that classroom. They must teach other children while dealing with disruptions. Teachers are trained to not let other kids disrupt by not giving that child attention.\n So that's the teacher portion. What can you do as the parent? Are you having daily email exchanges with the teacher? Setting up monthly parent teacher conferences. Meeting with the guidance counselor and your child. Is their a learning disability and your child is afraid to admit or doesn't even know?\n You can even visit with child therapists who on a professional level know how to work with children.\n And the 3rd element is your child. There are different ways to get your child to open up through playing, coloring, making projects together and asking questions. Are your (child)ren having trouble making friends, require special attention for classwork. Is he having trouble with homework? Is he seeking more time with you as a parent?\n And are you as the parent offering positive reinforcement for appropriate behavior while explaining the loss of privileges and activities he enjoys.\n Listen, blaming anyone is not the answer and being a little more involved in the process, albeit as frustrating as it is, can only work for the best. There are some great parenting books if you need ideas 💡.\n All the best. Take one day at a time. Destress. 👍🏼💛\n"

    "question": "What was trench warfare like in World War I?",
    "answer": "Imagine a field. Two enemies confront each other on the field and engage. The remaining forces retreat from each other and each dig a hole maybe 6–8 feet deep. They put some planks on the bottom of the trench to make the muddy, dirty, rat-infested, diseased conditions less noticeable.\nThis whole time, howitzers and mortars are placed along the trenches, and the forces fire upon each other for days, weeks, or in some cases, months on end. All the while, the soldiers were forced to withstand the mental strain of listening to deafening artillery shells and shots, and some couldn't handle that, resulting in the phrase, “shell shocked.”\nThen, the worst part came. The rush across No Man's Land. One side would leave it's trench, sending hundreds or thousands of men to rush across a mess of barbed wire, decaying bodies and shell craters towards the enemy's fort. Meanwhile, the enemy would fire upon the approaching soldiers, inflicting thousands of casualties.\nThis would continue with waves after waves of soldiers sent across No Man's Land until a trench was overrun, the enemy surrendered, or the enemy retreated. This way of warfare took a heavy toll on the terrain and the thousands of soldiers, usually only for a couple miles or kilometres to be gained.\n"

    "question": "Can I get a German long-term visa after getting a court martial?",
    "answer": "Basically yes. This depends on whether the issue of your court martial resulted in an entry in your civilian criminal record. German authorities have very limited access to foreign military records of allied forces and they need a very good reason to make a request. You will however have to fill in an application form which will ask whether you have ever been convicted of a crime. This only applies for crimes listed in your civilian criminal record as *that* can easily be accessed by German immigration authorities upon request. Answering truthfully will not automatically lead to your application being denied. It depends on the type of crime and whether you have paid your fine or done your time and are thus in good standing with your country again. It also depends on how long ago that was. If your entry would have been cleared from your record in Germany due to its age, Germany will regard that entry nonexistent. Also, Germany will only recognise crimes which would equally be a crime under the law of the Federal Republic of Germany. So, if for example someone had been convicted and sentenced for blasphemy in their country this would be ignored as blasphemy is not considered a crime in the FRG and thus not punishable.\n"

    "question": "What was the best naval big gun of WW2?",
    "answer": "9 18.1 inch naval guns were installed on the Japanese battleships Yamato and Musashi. A few more may have been constructed for the Battleship Shinano, which was laid down as a battleship of the Yamato class, but was finished as an aircraft carrier when the Japanese realized that carriers, not battleships were likely to be the crucial weapons of decision in the Pacific War.\n Designed to fire over 20 miles, the Yamato's main naval amaments were designed to outrange and outclass the 16 inch guns of her primary adversary, The United States Navy. Unfortunately for these weapons, the aircraft carrier really was a great deal more useful in the vast expanses of the Pacific theater. Neither Yamato nor Musashi ever engaged enemy battleships. Both were sunk by carrier born aircraft, the Musashi in the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea during the massive Leyte Operation in October of 1944, and the Yamato went down in April of 1945 off of Okinawa on a suicide mission to disrupt the American landings there.\n Although these huge canons might have been decisive in an action between enemy battle lines, very few engagements happened of this type in World War II. Even so, it is quite possible that after 1944, American radar-assisted gunnery would have proved superior. In the one engagement between Japanese and American battleships, the Battle of Surigao Strait, an American fleet of several battleships and cruisers decisively destroyed two Japanese battleships with very minor losses using radar controlled gunnery in a night action.\n"

    "question": "If Biden forgives student loan debt, why not cancel the GI Bill for veterans?",
    "answer": "There is a lot of confusion here. The concept of targeted Government aid should not be, and isn’t, based on “fairness” or “earned value.” As is being pointed out in other places, some of those most critical of the student loan forgiveness program were themselves targets of much larger government aid in the Covid economic collapse (like Marjorie Taylor Green’s $180,000 of debt forgiveness).\n The discussion here is clearly along political division. If you like Marjorie, you think it is fine that her $180,000 was forgiven. If Marjorie had been a Democrat, you’d be screaming that it is unfair. But that is not the discussion intelligent people should be having.\n The real point of such target actions is the betterment of the economy for all of us. The student load is not about fairness or earned value, it is about improving the economy for the general welfare, as is directed in the US Constitution. So the real discussion, which grown-ups would be having, relates to the question of whether actions that benefit the Marjorie Taylor Greens or our young people who went to college worth their price tag? The same argument applies to aid like welfare, or social security, or medicare, or public schools, or the US highway system, or a host of other things that the government pays for.\n And yes, all of us are in this together, and by the people we elect, we are responsible for how our government operates and spends tax money. It is not “Democrats trying to get votes.” It is “Democrats who honestly believe this will help the economy in the long run.” And frankly, history and facts demonstrate that these programs do help all of us in the long run. The economy historically performs better whenever Democratic policies are in effect.\n"

    "question": "I want to use C++ to learn Machine Learning instead of Python or R, is it fine?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is fine to use C++ to learn machine learning. While Python is a popular language for machine learning, C++ can also be used effectively for this purpose.\n C++ is a high-performance language that can be used to build machine learning models and systems that are optimized for speed and efficiency. It is also commonly used in scientific computing and data analysis, making it a good choice for machine learning tasks.\n There are several libraries and frameworks available for machine learning in C++, such as TensorFlow C++, Caffe, and mlpack. These libraries provide a wide range of machine learning algorithms and tools, including support for neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines.\n However, it is important to note that Python is often the preferred language for machine learning due to its simplicity, readability, and the large number of libraries and frameworks available for it. It also has a vibrant community of users and developers, making it easier to find support and resources for learning and using Python for machine learning.\n In general, the choice of language for machine learning is often based on personal preference, the specific requirements of the task at hand, and the resources and tools available. It is worth considering both Python and C++, as well as other languages, when choosing a language for machine learning.\n"
