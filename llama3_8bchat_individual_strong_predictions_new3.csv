To restore the economic position of the black community to what it would have been if it had not been subjected to slavery and discrimination.
To compensate for the estimated $1.4 trillion in losses African Americans have suffered due to slavery, race riots, lynching, and institutional discrimination.
To address the continued effects of slavery and Jim Crow laws, which have resulted in a legacy of racial inequality and negative impacts on the civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights of African Americans.

The anticipated cost of enacting slavery reparations varies widely, with estimates ranging from:

$1.4 trillion to $4.7 trillion, or roughly $142,000 (equivalent to $162,000 in 2021) for every black American living today.
$5.7 to $14.2 trillion.
$17.1 trillion.","In spite of progressive changes since the end of enforcement of Jim Crow and the successes of the fight for civil rights there are still inherent racial inequalities in the USA which negatively affect the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of African Americans today.  A United Nations report of 2016 did not endorse a specific reparations proposal, but did call out that there is an ideology of white supremacy present in the population of the United States that inhibits social cohesion.  Further arguments have been made identifying slavery as a cause of mass incarcerations, poverty and other ills that affect today’s African Americans.
It could be argued that there is an inherent acknowledgement that the case exists to examine the impact of slavery on the social, political and economic life of the United States in the annual submission to Congress of the ""Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act”.  There are also individual cities within the USA which have instituted reparations.  Estimates of the cost to African Americans of the United States’ history of discrimination have been estimated variously at $1.4 trillion, $4.7 trillion, $5.7 trillion, $14.2 trillion and $17.1 trillion.  These estimates express the projected cost in $ to restore the black community to the economic position it would have if it had not been subjected to slavery and discrimination."

dolly,id50,human,Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in Athens in the early 3rd century BCE. It is a philosophy of personal virtue ethics that asserts that the practice of virtue is both necessary and sufficient to achieve eudaimonia (happiness).,"Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in Athens in the early 3rd century BCE. It is a philosophy of personal virtue ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world, asserting that the practice of virtue is both necessary and sufficient to achieve eudaimonia (happiness, lit. 'good spiritedness'): one flourishes by living an ethical life. The Stoics identified the path to eudaimonia with a life spent practicing virtue and living in accordance with nature.
Alongside Aristotelian ethics, the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to virtue ethics. The Stoics are especially known for teaching that ""virtue is the only good"" for human beings, and that external things, such as health, wealth, and pleasure, are not good or bad in themselves (adiaphora) but have value as ""material for virtue to act upon"". Many Stoics—such as Seneca and Epictetus—emphasized that because ""virtue is sufficient for happiness"", a sage would be emotionally resilient to misfortune. The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should aim to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is ""in accordance with nature"". Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they believed everything was rooted in nature.
Stoicism flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century CE, and among its adherents was Emperor Marcus Aurelius. It experienced a decline after Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century CE. Since then, it has seen revivals, notably in the Renaissance (Neostoicism) and in the contemporary era (modern Stoicism)."

dolly,id64,human,"The War of 1812 was fought between the United States and the United Kingdom, with limited participation by Spain, from 1812 to 1815. The war was sparked by tensions over territorial expansion and British support for Native American tribes opposing US colonial settlement in the Northwest Territory.","The War of 1812 (18 June 1812 – 17 February 1815) was fought by the United States of America and its indigenous allies against the United Kingdom and its allies in British North America, with limited participation by Spain in Florida. It began when the United States declared war on 18 June 1812. Although peace terms were agreed upon in the December 1814 Treaty of Ghent, the war did not officially end until the peace treaty was ratified by Congress on 17 February 1815.
Tensions originated in long-standing differences over territorial expansion in North America and British support for Native American tribes who opposed U.S. colonial settlement in the Northwest Territory. These escalated in 1807 after the Royal Navy began enforcing tighter restrictions on American trade with France and press-ganged men they claimed as British subjects, even those with American citizenship certificates. Opinion in the U.S. was split on how to respond, and although majorities in both the House and Senate voted for war, they divided along strict party lines, with the Democratic-Republican Party in favour and the Federalist Party against. News of British concessions made in an attempt to avoid war did not reach the U.S. until late July, by which time the conflict was already underway.
At sea, the far larger Royal Navy imposed an effective blockade on U.S. maritime trade, while between 1812 to 1814 British regulars and colonial militia defeated a series of American attacks on Upper Canada. This was balanced by the US winning control of the Northwest Territory with victories at Lake Erie and the Thames in 1813. The abdication of Napoleon in early 1814 allowed the British to send additional troops to North America and the Royal Navy to reinforce their blockade, crippling the American economy. In August 1814, negotiations began in Ghent, with both sides wanting peace; the British economy had been severely impacted by the trade embargo, while the Federalists convened the Hartford Convention in December to formalise their opposition to the war.
In August 1814, British troops burned Washington, before American victories at Baltimore and Plattsburgh in September ended fighting in the north. Fighting continued in the Southeastern United States, where in late 1813 a civil war had broken out between a Creek faction supported by Spanish and British traders and those backed by the U.S. Supported by U.S. militia under General Andrew Jackson, the U.S.-backed Creeks won a series of victories, culminating in the capture of Pensacola in November 1814. In early 1815, Jackson defeated a British attack on New Orleans, catapulting him to national celebrity and later victory in the 1828 United States presidential election. News of this success arrived in Washington at the same time as that of the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, which essentially restored the position to that prevailing before the war. While Britain insisted this included lands belonging to their Native American allies prior to 1811, as Congress did not recognize them as independent nations, the Americans did not comply with these provisions and the British made no effort to compel them to do so. The Native Americans were subsequently pushed west of the Mississippi River."

They compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA), as a member of the league's Western Conference Pacific Division. The Suns are the only team in their division not to be based in California, and play their home games at the Footprint Center. The Suns are one of four major league sports teams based in the Phoenix area, but are the only one to bill themselves as representing the city (the other teams - the Cardinals, Coyotes, and Diamondbacks - all bill themselves as representing the state of Arizona).
The franchise began play in 1968 as an expansion team, and their early years were mired in mediocrity, but their fortunes changed in the 1970s after partnering Dick Van Arsdale and Alvan Adams with Paul Westphal; the team reached the 1976 NBA Finals, in what is considered to be one of the biggest upsets in NBA history. However, after failing to capture a championship, the Suns would rebuild around Walter Davis for a majority of the 1980s, until the acquisition of Kevin Johnson in 1988.
Under Johnson, and after trading for perennial NBA All-Star Charles Barkley, and combined with the output of Tom Chambers and Dan Majerle, the Suns reached the playoffs for a franchise-record thirteen consecutive appearances and remained a regular title contender throughout the 1990s, and reached the 1993 NBA Finals. However, the team would again fail to win a championship, and entered into another period of mediocrity until the early part of the 2000s.
In 2004, the Suns signed free agent Steve Nash (who had blossomed for the Dallas Mavericks after being traded from Phoenix six years earlier), and returned into playoff contention. With Nash, Shawn Marion, and Amar'e Stoudemire, and under head coach Mike D'Antoni, the Suns became renowned worldwide for their quick, dynamic offense, which led them to tie a franchise record in wins in the 2004–05 season. Two more top two Conference placements followed, but the Suns again failed to attain an NBA championship, and were forced into another rebuild. After ten consecutive seasons without a playoff berth, the Suns reached the 2021 NBA Finals after acquiring Chris Paul, forming a quartet with their young core of Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton and Mikal Bridges. Following a disappointing playoff exit in 2022, the Suns acquired 13-time All-Star and two-time NBA champion Kevin Durant.
The Suns own the NBA's fifth-best all-time winning percentage, and have the second highest winning percentage of any team to have never won an NBA championship. 11 Hall of Famers have played for Phoenix, while two — Barkley and Nash — won NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) while playing for the team.

This caused a stir in the room, several questions came flying at once. When asked when the regulations would take effect, Schabowski replied hesitantly, ""As far as I know, it takes effect immediately, without delay"".

The event is traditionally held over Memorial Day weekend, usually the last weekend of May. It is contested as part of the IndyCar Series, the top level of American open-wheel car racing, a formula colloquially known as ""Indy car racing"". The track itself is nicknamed the ""Brickyard"", as the racing surface was paved in brick in the fall of 1909. One yard of brick remains exposed at the start/finish line. The event, billed as The Greatest Spectacle in Racing, is considered part of the Triple Crown of Motorsport along with the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Monaco Grand Prix, with which it typically shares a date.
The inaugural race was held in 1911 and was won by Ray Harroun. The event celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2011, and the 100th running was held in 2016. The event was put on hiatus twice, from 1917 to 1918 due to World War I and from 1942 to 1945 due to World War II. In two different periods, the race was part of FIA World Championships; between 1925 and 1928, the World Manufacturers' Championship and between 1950 and 1960, the World Drivers' Championship.
Marcus Ericsson is the current champion. The most successful drivers are A. J. Foyt, Al Unser Sr., Rick Mears and Hélio Castroneves, each of whom has won the race four times. The active driver with the most victories is Hélio Castroneves. Rick Mears holds the record for most career pole positions with six. The most successful car owner is Roger Penske, owner of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Team Penske, which has 18 total wins and 18 poles. Penske also has five wins at the IndyCar Grand Prix, held on the combined road course.
The event is steeped in tradition, in pre-race ceremonies, post-race celebrations, and race procedure. The most noteworthy and most popular traditions are the 33-car field lining up three-wide for the start, the annual singing of the chorus of ""Back Home Again in Indiana,"" and the victory lane bottle of milk. Also unique is that qualifying requires the driver to complete four, rather than one, timed laps. Qualifying has a separate weekend.

In his later years, Applegate continued to be involved in politics and was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1892.

From there, Oliver spent several years working under multiple agency administrations which allowed him to gain influence over the tribes of southeastern Oregon.

The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after signing to EMI Records and achieving their first hit, ""Love Me Do"", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed ""Beatlemania"", the band acquired the nickname ""the Fab Four"", with Epstein, Martin or another member of the band's entourage sometimes informally referred to as a ""fifth Beatle"".
By early 1964, the Beatles were international stars and had achieved unprecedented levels of critical and commercial success. They became a leading force in Britain's cultural resurgence, ushering in the British Invasion of the United States pop market, and soon made their film debut with A Hard Day's Night (1964). A growing desire to refine their studio efforts, coupled with the untenable nature of their concert tours, led to the band's retirement from live performances in 1966. At this time, they produced records of greater sophistication, including the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also known as ""the White Album"", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). The success of these records heralded the album era, as albums became the dominant form of record consumption over singles; they also increased public interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and furthered advancements in electronic music, album art and music videos. In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After the group's break-up in 1970, all principal former members enjoyed success as solo artists and some partial reunions have occurred. Lennon was murdered in 1980 and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.
The Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide. They are the most successful act in the history of the US Billboard charts. They hold the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart (15), most number-one hits on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart (20), and most singles sold in the UK (21.9 million). The band received many accolades, including seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 documentary film Let It Be) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and each principal member was inducted individually between 1994 and 2015.

dolly,id266,human,"Archimedes' principle is a rule that helps us understand how objects behave when they're in water or any other liquid. Imagine you have a toy boat that you put in a bathtub. The boat will start to rise up out of the water because the water is pushing it up. This is because the water is taking up space that the boat would normally be taking up, so the water is ""lifting"" the boat up.

The reason this happens is because the water is pushing down on the boat with a force that is equal to the weight of the water that the boat is pushing out of the way. So, if you have a toy boat that weighs 1 pound, and it pushes out 1 pound of water, then the water will push back up on the boat with a force of 1 pound, making it rise up. This is what Archimedes' principle is all about - the idea that the weight of the water that an object displaces is equal to the weight of the object itself.","When you immerse an object under water, it pushes the water away in order to take its place.
The water wants to get back to where it was before and pushes the object away, towards the surface.
Then it depends what is the weight of the object, compared with how much water was moved.
Imagine you could put your object on one side of a balance, and on the other side, you would duplicate your object and transform it into water (representing how much water is moved if you were to plunge put your object under water).
If your original object is lighter than its equivalent in water, like a bubble for example, or a balloon, the water will be strong enough to have the object to float.
If the object is heavier than its equivalent water, like a bowling ball, or a rock, the water will not be able to push hard enough, and the object will sink."

The primary military objectives were to deny the Allies use of the Belgian Port of Antwerp and to split the Allied lines, potentially allowing the Germans to encircle and destroy the four Allied forces.
The battle was launched through the Ardennes region between Belgium and Luxembourg.
The Germans achieved a total surprise attack due to a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance due to bad weather.
American forces bore the brunt of the attack and put up fierce resistance on the northern and southern shoulders of the offensive.

The Americans suffered","• The Battle of the Bulge, also known as the Ardennes Offensive, was the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front during World War II.
• The battle lasted for five weeks from 16 December 1944 to 28 January 1945, towards the end of the war in Europe.
• The primary military objectives were to deny further use of the Belgian Port of Antwerp to the Allies and to split the Allied lines, which potentially could have allowed the Germans to encircle and destroy the four Allied forces.
• The Germans achieved a total surprise attack on the morning of 16 December 1944, due to a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance due to bad weather.
• The farthest west the offensive reached was the village of Foy-Nôtre-Dame, south east of Dinant, being stopped by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division on 24 December 1944.
• On 26 December the lead element of Patton's U.S. Third Army reached Bastogne from the south, ending the siege.
• The battle severely depleted Germany's armored forces, which remained largely unreplaced throughout the remainder of the war.
• The ""Bulge"" was the largest and bloodiest single battle fought by the United States in World War II and the third-deadliest campaign in American history."

dolly,id323,human,Lewis Hamilton is a British racing driver who currently competes in Formula One for the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team.,"Born and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton joined the McLaren young driver programme in 1998 at the age of 13, becoming the youngest racing driver ever to be contracted by a Formula One team. This led to a Formula One drive with McLaren for six years from 2007 to 2012, making Hamilton the first ever black driver to race in the series. In his inaugural season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi Räikkönen by one point. The following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion—making a crucial overtake at the last corner on the last lap of the last race of the season—to become the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history. After six years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013.
Changes to the regulations for 2014 mandating the use of turbo-hybrid engines saw the start of a highly successful period for Hamilton, during which he won six further drivers' titles. Consecutive titles came in 2014 and 2015 during an intense rivalry with teammate Nico Rosberg. Following Rosberg's retirement in 2016, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival in two championship battles, in which Hamilton twice overturned mid-season point deficits to claim consecutive titles again in 2017 and 2018. His third and fourth consecutive titles followed in 2019 and 2020 to equal Schumacher's record of seven drivers' titles. Hamilton achieved his 100th pole position and race win during the 2021 season.
Hamilton has been credited with furthering Formula One's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle, environmental and social activism, and exploits in music and fashion. He has also become a prominent advocate in support of activism to combat racism and push for increased diversity in motorsport. Hamilton was the highest-paid Formula One driver from 2013 to 2021, and was ranked as one of the world's highest-paid athletes by Forbes of twenty-tens decade and 2021.

dolly,id370,human,"According to the article, a perpetrator's state of mind, known as animus nocendi, is the subjective state of mind that demonstrates the perpetrator's exact knowledge of the illegal content of their behavior and its possible consequences. The elements that demonstrate animus nocendi are:

1. Knowledge of a law that prohibited the action or conduct
2. Knowledge of the most likely consequences of the action
3. Precise intention of breaking the law or causing the verified effects of the action

If a perpetrator has animus nocendi, it is considered an essential condition for a penal condemnation. However, if the perpetrator does not have animus nocendi, they may still be held responsible for their actions, but not necessarily guilty of the crime. Instead, they may be held responsible for a different aspect of their conduct, such as a reckless or hazardous maneuver, which indirectly caused the harm.","In most legal systems, it is required to demonstrate that the perpetrator of a crime had intent to harm, also known by the legal term ""animus nocendi""(from the Latin animus ""mind"" and noceo ""to harm""). Put plainly, this means having foreknowledge of the illegality of his act and the repercussions of the crime. Intention is important in establishing guilt for a specific crime. A good example is a car accident fatality: the driver responsible would be guilty of causing the accidental death of the victim (manslaughter), but not guilty of murder -- unless it could be established that the driver at fault intended to kill the victim."

dolly,id375,human,"The article does not explicitly state the difference between the right and left side of the brain. It only mentions that the two hemispheres have different composition of neuronal networks, allowing for specialized function that is different in each hemisphere, but it does not provide specific information on what those differences are.","The lateralization of brain function is the tendency for some neural functions or cognitive processes to be specialized to one side of the brain or the other. The median longitudinal fissure separates the human brain into two distinct cerebral hemispheres, connected by the corpus callosum. Although the macrostructure of the two hemispheres appears to be almost identical, different composition of neuronal networks allows for specialized function that is different in each hemisphere.
Lateralization of brain structures is based on general trends expressed in healthy patients; however, there are numerous counterexamples to each generalization. Each human's brain develops differently, leading to unique lateralization in individuals. This is different from specialization, as lateralization refers only to the function of one structure divided between two hemispheres. Specialization is much easier to observe as a trend, since it has a stronger anthropological history.
The best example of an established lateralization is that of Broca's and Wernicke's areas, where both are often found exclusively on the left hemisphere. Function lateralization, such as semantics, intonation, accentuation, and prosody, has since been called into question and largely been found to have a neuronal basis in both hemispheres. Another example is that each hemisphere in the brain tends to represent one side of the body. In the cerebellum, this is the same body side, but in the forebrain this is predominantly the contralateral side.
Language functions such as grammar, vocabulary and literal meaning are typically lateralized to the left hemisphere, especially in right-handed individuals. While language production is left-lateralized in up to 90% of right-handers, it is more bilateral, or even right-lateralized, in approximately 50% of left-handers.
Broca's area and Wernicke's area, associated with the production of speech and comprehension of speech, respectively, are located in the left cerebral hemisphere for about 95% of right-handers but about 70% of left-handers. 69  Individuals who speak multiple languages demonstrate separate speech areas for each language.
The processing of basic sensory information is lateralized by being divided into left and right sides of the body or the space around the body.
In vision, about half the neurons of the optic nerve from each eye cross to project to the opposite hemisphere, and about half do not cross to project to the hemisphere on the same side. This means that the left side of the visual field is processed largely by the visual cortex of the right hemisphere and vice versa for the right side of the visual field.
In hearing, about 90% of the neurons of the auditory nerve from one ear cross to project to the auditory cortex of the opposite hemisphere.
In the sense of touch, most of the neurons from the skin cross to project to the somatosensory cortex of the opposite hemisphere.
Because of this functional division of the left and right sides of the body and of the space that surrounds it, the processing of information in the sensory cortices is essentially identical. That is, the processing of visual and auditory stimuli, spatial manipulation, facial perception, and artistic ability are represented bilaterally. Numerical estimation, comparison and online calculation depend on bilateral parietal regions while exact calculation and fact retrieval are associated with left parietal regions, perhaps due to their ties to linguistic processing.
Rather than just being a series of places where different brain modules occur, there are running similarities in the kind of function seen in each side, for instance how right-side impairment of drawing ability making patients draw the parts of the subject matter with wholly incoherent relationships, or where the kind of left-side damage seen in language impairment not damaging the patient's ability to catch the significance of intonation in speech. This has led British psychiatrist Iain McGilchrist to view the two hemispheres as having different value systems, where the left hemisphere tends to reduce complex matters such as ethics to rules and measures, and the right hemisphere is disposed to the holistic and metaphorical.
Depression is linked with a hyperactive right hemisphere. The delusional misidentification syndromes, reduplicative paramnesia and Capgras delusion are also often the result of right hemisphere lesions.
Damage to either the right or left hemisphere, and its resulting deficits provide insight into the function of the damaged area. Left hemisphere damage has many effects on language production and perception. Damage or lesions to the right hemisphere can result in a lack of emotional prosody or intonation when speaking. Right hemisphere damage also has grave effects on understanding discourse. People with damage to the right hemisphere have a reduced ability to generate inferences, comprehend and produce main concepts, and a reduced ability to manage alternative meanings. Furthermore, people with right hemisphere damage often exhibit discourse that is abrupt and perfunctory or verbose and excessive. They can also have pragmatic deficits in situations of turn taking, topic maintenance and shared knowledge.
Lateral brain damage can also affect visual perceptual spatial resolution. People with left hemisphere damage may have impaired perception of high resolution, or detailed, aspects of an image. People with right hemisphere damage may have impaired perception of low resolution, or big picture, aspects of an image.
If a specific region of the brain, or even an entire hemisphere, is injured or destroyed, its functions can sometimes be assumed by a neighboring region in the same hemisphere or the corresponding region in the other hemisphere, depending upon the area damaged and the patient's age. When injury interferes with pathways from one area to another, alternative (indirect) connections may develop to communicate information with detached areas, despite the inefficiencies.
Broca's aphasia is a specific type of expressive aphasia and is so named due to the aphasia that results from damage or lesions to the Broca's area of the brain, that exists most commonly in the left inferior frontal hemisphere. Thus, the aphasia that develops from the lack of functioning of the Broca's area is an expressive and non-fluent aphasia. It is called 'non-fluent' due to the issues that arise because Broca's area is critical for language pronunciation and production. The area controls some motor aspects of speech production and articulation of thoughts to words and as such lesions to the area result in specific non-fluent aphasia.
Wernicke's aphasia is the result of damage to the area of the brain that is commonly in the left hemisphere above the Sylvian fissure. Damage to this area causes primarily a deficit in language comprehension. While the ability to speak fluently with normal melodic intonation is spared, the language produced by a person with Wernicke's aphasia is riddled with semantic errors and may sound nonsensical to the listener. Wernicke's aphasia is characterized by phonemic paraphasias, neologism or jargon. Another characteristic of a person with Wernicke's aphasia is that they are unconcerned by the mistakes that they are making.
Terence Hines states that the research on brain lateralization is valid as a research program, though commercial promoters have applied it to promote subjects and products far outside the implications of the research. For example, the implications of the research have no bearing on psychological interventions such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and neurolinguistic programming, brain-training equipment, or management training.
Some popularizations oversimplify the science about lateralization, by presenting the functional differences between hemispheres as being more absolute than is actually the case. Interestingly, research has shown quite opposite function of brain lateralisation, i.e. left hemisphere creatively and chaotically links between concepts and right hemisphere tends to adhere to specific date and time, although generally adhering to the pattern of left-brain as linguistic interpretation and right brain as spatio-temporal.
In the 19th century and to a lesser extent the 20th, it was thought that each side of the brain was associated with a specific gender: the left corresponding with masculinity and the right with femininity and each half could function independently. The right side of the brain was seen as the inferior and thought to be prominent in women, savages, children, criminals, and the insane. A prime example of this in fictional literature can be seen in Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."

dolly,id502,human,The Masters Tournament is one of the four major championships in professional golf.,"The Masters was started by amateur champion Bobby Jones and investment banker Clifford Roberts. After his grand slam in 1930, Jones acquired the former plant nursery and co-designed Augusta National with course architect Alister MacKenzie. First played 89 years ago in 1934, the tournament is an official money event on the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour. The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.
The tournament has a number of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless they need to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Lee Elder, and Tom Watson. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.
Nicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. Tiger Woods won five between 1997 and 2019. Palmer won four between 1958 and 1964. Five have won three titles at Augusta: Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead, Gary Player, Nick Faldo, and Phil Mickelson. Player, from South Africa, was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in 1961; the second was Seve Ballesteros of Spain, the champion in 1980 and 1983.
The Augusta National course first opened 90 years ago in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed."

Given the variety of environments that RL can operate in, there are a range of approaches that the agent can take and are broadly categarized as six different approaches:
1. Associated RL - which combines traditional approaches of Machine Learning classification with the automated learning on random, or stochastically distributed results.
2. Deep RL - which leverages traditional deep neural networks but allows for flexibility and a lack of pre-defined layers and the state space.
3. Adversarial Deep RL - where end results are compared using vulnerabilities in state stored in Deep Neural Networks and attempts to find weaknesses in these models.
4. Fuzzy RL - which leverages a near natural language definition of if-then fuzzy rules which determine the calculation of the value of a result.
5. Inverse RL - which removes the common reward function evaluation part of the model and instead injects a human to observe and evalutate the results.
6. Safe RL - is an approach to defining policies that also takes into account the behavior of the agent in the envionment, such that those agent steps are reasonaable or respect safety constraints."

dolly,id583,human,"Rafael Nadal succeeds on clay due to his ""prowess"" and ""mechanical yet fluid approach"", allowing him to dominate on the red dirt like having ""Infinite Ammo"" in a Grand Theft Auto game.","Rafael Nadal on clay is like a Grand Theft Auto game with the 'Infinite Ammo' cheat code enabled. Several have compared the Spaniard displaying his prowess on the red dirt to Picasso painting a live mural, Ennio Morricone producing a melody exactly congruent with the scenario, or Jorge Lorenzo posting similar times lap after lap in an almost mechanical yet fluid approach.
Rafael Nadal's ability on clay is mostly due to the surface itself. This may appear to be a quip, but the particular qualities of claycourts - which distinguish them from grass and hardcourts - are a fundamental reason why Rafael Nadal has dominated the surface the way he has.
What distinguishes clay? It's sluggish and bouncy. Fundamentally, clay reduces the speed of the ball once it bounces on the surface. Of course, there's more to it than just making the game slow and monotonous, but that's the distinguishing quality of a claycourt.
The surface is also less skiddish than grass or hard, allowing the ball to bounce high, which suits Rafael Nadal's high topspin-based game.
The slick nature of grass and hardcourt surfaces has been one of Rafael Nadal's main challenges throughout his career. Because there is significantly more skid on the ball on grass and hard than on clay, the ball tends to stay low. That in turn takes away vital time from the Spaniard to apply enough topspin.
For many of Rafael Nadal's career, his allegedly subpar serve in compared to his opponents was regarded as his most serious flaw. When his ground game isn't functioning, Nadal rarely has the luxury of a great first serve that can bail him out of trouble. To save break points, the 19-time Grand Slam champion frequently needs to drag out rallies.
Despite having a somewhat weak serve for the majority of his career, Rafael Nadal has able to take use of his southpaw serve on the ad side (to a right-handed opponent's normally weaker side). And nowhere has he done it better than on his favourite red dirt; just ask Roger Federer how much it sucks for the opponent.
The southpaw's serve forces the right-handed returner wide into his backhand corner, resulting in a weak return. This opens up practically the entire court for Rafael Nadal to unleash his most lethal weapon, the forehand down the line.
Rafael Nadal's obsession with patterns has been a feature of his game throughout his career, regardless of the surface.
In fact, because he is preoccupied on keeping to his rallying patterns, Nadal sometimes lets go of an opening and misses a chance to strike a winner into the open court. On social media, this has become known as Nadal's ""Open Court atheism."""

dolly,id645,human,"The poem ""since feeling is first"" by ee cummings is an ode to the power of emotions and the importance of living in the present moment. The speaker argues that those who prioritize syntax and logic over feeling will never truly experience the beauty of life. The poem suggests that emotions are more valuable than wisdom and that the simplest gestures, such as a flutter of eyelids, can convey deeper meaning than complex thoughts.

The speaker declares their devotion to the beloved, swearing by all flowers and imploring them not to cry. Instead, they invite the beloved to laugh and be together, emphasizing that life is not a structured narrative, but rather a fluid and ever-changing experience.

The poem's final line, ""And death i think is no parenthesis"", suggests that death is not a pause or interruption in the grand narrative of life, but rather an integral part of the human experience. Overall, the poem is a celebration of the beauty and complexity of human emotions, and the importance of embracing life's uncertainties with an open heart.","Since feeling is first is a love poem, written to an unknown recipient that appears to share a close relationship with the writer. The poem employs an unorthodox syntactic structure to highlight how logic and rationality (i.e. thinking) can interfere with one's ability to embrace the love and beauty that exists in life via feelings. There are numerous examples in the poem that support the primacy of feeling over thinking (""kisses are a better fate than wisdom"", ""the best gesture of my brain is less than your eyelids' flutter""). 
Grammatical terms appear in the final lines as a metaphor describing the poet's thoughts on life and death. The statement that ""life is not a paragraph"" suggests that life is a collection of feelings and experiences that cannot be summarized adequately on paper. The author's mention that ""death i think is no parenthesis"" indicates that for him, death does not explain or provide meaning to the life that was lived before it, since parenthesis are typically used to clarify the prior passage."

-Compensation: The theory of compensation states that individuals find refuge from work and its deficiencies in their home lives and the satisfaction that comes from their families.
-Supplemental and Reactive Compensation: Supplemental and reactive compensation are two theories that describe the ways in which individuals pursue alternative forms of life satisfaction while caught between the work and family social spheres.

dolly,id688,human,"In postcolonial theory, inversion refers to a modality of resistance where the colonized or oppressed group reverses the dominant power structures and challenges the colonizer's monopoly on violence. This can take various forms, such as forcing the colonizer to adopt the colonized's practices or reversing the dominant group's cultural and economic power. The term is often associated with the works of Frantz Fanon, who argued that a reversal of the colonizer's violence is necessary to break free from the master-slave dialectic and the learned sense of cultural inferiority.

Inversion can also take the form of imagery, such as an ox killing a butcher, which is described as ""inversion woodcuts"" in peasant studies. This type of imagery challenges the dominant narrative and power structures, and can be seen as a form of resistance against oppression.

However, some critics argue that attaching positive values to an essence of the oppressed, such as black consciousness or Afrocentric ideas, can also be seen as an instance of inversion. Edward Said, for example, argues that these essences can be used to cover up contemporary faults and corruptions, and that they often originate from embattled imperial contexts","The term derives from studies of modalities of resistance by the Subaltern Studies school, but reflects concerns pervasive from the earliest days of post- and anti-colonial writing.

Maximus becomes a gladiator and rises through the ranks to avenge the murders of his family and the emperor.","In 180 AD, Hispano-Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius intends to return home after he leads the Roman army to victory against the Germanic tribes near Vindobona on the Limes Germanicus. Emperor Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that his own son, Commodus, is unfit to rule and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to help save Rome from corruption and restore the republic. When told of this, Commodus privately murders his father.
Commodus proclaims himself the new emperor, asking Maximus for his loyalty, but he refuses. Maximus is arrested by the Praetorian Guard and is told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and, wounded, rides for his home near Turgalium (now Trujillo), where he finds his wife and son crucified. Maximus buries them, then collapses from his injuries. Slavers find him, and take him to the city of Zucchabar in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis, where he is sold to gladiator trainer Proximo.
Maximus reluctantly fights in local tournaments, his combat skills helping him win matches and gain popularity. He befriends two other gladiators: Hagen, a German; and Juba, a Numidian. Proximo reveals to Maximus that he was once a gladiator who was freed by Marcus Aurelius, and advises him to ""win the crowd"" to win his freedom.
When Commodus organises 150 days of games to commemorate his father's death, Proximo takes his gladiators to Rome to fight in the Colosseum. Disguised in a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in the Colosseum as a Carthaginian in a re-enactment of the Battle of Zama. Unexpectedly, he leads his side to victory, and Commodus enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations. He orders the disguised Maximus, as leader of the gladiators, to reveal his identity; Maximus removes his helmet and declares vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let the gladiators live, and his guards are held back from striking them down.
Maximus's next fight is against a legendary undefeated gladiator, Tigris of Gaul. Commodus arranges for several tigers to be set upon Maximus during the duel, but Maximus manages to prevail. Commodus orders Maximus to kill Tigris, but Maximus spares his opponent's life; in response, the crowd chants ""Maximus the Merciful"", angering Commodus.
Maximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal. He meets in secret with Lucilla, Commodus's sister and once the lover of Maximus; and Gracchus, an influential senator. They agree to have Maximus escape Rome to join his legions, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the Roman Senate. Commodus learns of the plot when Lucilla's son, Lucius, innocently hints at the conspiracy. Commodus threatens Lucilla and Lucius, and has the Praetorian Guard arrest Gracchus and attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where the latter is killed.
In an effort to win back public approval, Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum. He stabs Maximus in the lung before the match to gain an advantage. Despite his injuries, Maximus disarms Commodus. After the Praetorian Guard refuses to aid him, Commodus unsheathes a hidden knife; Maximus overpowers Commodus and drives the knife into his throat, killing him. Before Maximus succumbs to his wounds, he asks for political reforms, for his gladiator allies to be freed, and for Senator Gracchus to be reinstated. As he dies, he has a vision where he reunites with his wife and son. His friends and allies honor him as ""a soldier of Rome"", at Lucilla's behest, and carry his body out of the arena, while the body of Commodus is left behind.
That night, Juba visits the Colosseum and buries figurines of Maximus's wife and son at the spot where he died."

However, binary search is usually more efficient for searching than other searching schemes such as binary search trees, which may be imperfectly balanced and result in slightly worse performance.","Sorted arrays with the binary search are a very inefficient solution when insertion and deletion operations are interleaved with retrieval. In addition, sorted arrays can complicate memory use especially when elements are often inserted into the array.

The article suggests that there must be another factor that sets Sachin apart, but does not specify what that factor is.","Sachin Tendulkar is wonderful not because of his cricketing prowess; if that were the case, roughly the same degree of adoration would have been held for Rahul Dravid, who is also in the same league in terms of performance...
164 Tests, 13288 runs at 52.88 versus Sachin's 200 Tests, 15921 runs at 53.86
As you can see, there is nothing to select between the two.
Of course, Sachin has a significant advantage in one-dayers: 39 vs 44 in averages. Yet not nearly enough to deserve Sachin's adoration.
Sachin is great in my opinion mostly because of his age when he first entered the cricket scene; to perform what he did at the age of 16 is incredible. Consider yourself at 16...and then consider Imran, Waqar, and Wasim blasting into you at 16 in front of a partisan crowd, with all of India watching. Consider yourself as a 16-year-old fighting the arch-enemy Pakistan. Imagine yourself at the age of 16 being smashed on the body with a leather ball. Consider yourself at 16 years old, attempting to focus on the ball in front of a roaring crowd.
That is what he did....

And a legend was born!
His achievements from 16 - 22 are the stuff of legend; and that is his primary claim to greatness.

Yes, there are other factors: his simplicity, his focus, his concentration, his determination, his longevity etc... but the primary one is the aspect listed above.

But even that does not explain his sustained claim to greatness over the years,
To this, we must add that he is a fighter who enjoys a good challenge. The manner he dealt with the top fast bowlers of the day, like as Allan Donald. And his famed war with Shane Warne... these battles, and more, when he faced the opposition, are unique to him; almost.

And then there's the fact that he's believed to have the purest game with the widest range of shots... To watch him bat is to witness beauty in action, poetry in motion. There is no better sight than Sachin in full flow...
And the icing on the cake?
He has succeeded in all forms of the game. Try and find me 2 other players who have done that."

dolly,id833,human,The Wimbledon Championships is the oldest tennis tournament in the world and is widely regarded as the most prestigious.,"The Wimbledon Championships, commonly known simply as Wimbledon, is the oldest tennis tournament in the world and is widely regarded as the most prestigious. It has been held at the All England Club in Wimbledon, London, since 1877 and is played on outdoor grass courts, with retractable roofs over the two main courts since 2019.
Wimbledon is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, the others being the Australian Open, the French Open, and the US Open. Wimbledon is the only major still played on grass, the traditional tennis playing surface. Also, it is the only Grand Slam that retains a night-time curfew, though matches can now continue until 11.00 pm under the lights.
The tournament traditionally takes place over two weeks in late June and early July, starting on the last Monday in June and culminating with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Finals, scheduled for the Saturday and Sunday at the end of the second week. Five major events are held each year, with additional junior and invitational competitions also taking place. In 2009, Wimbledon's Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain. A roof was operational over No. 1 Court from 2019, when a number of other improvements were made, including adding cushioned seating, a table and 10 independently operable cameras per court to capture the games.
Wimbledon traditions include a strict all-white dress code for competitors, and royal patronage. Strawberries and cream are traditionally consumed at the tournament. Unlike other tournaments, advertising is minimal and low key from official suppliers such as Slazenger and Rolex. The relationship with Slazenger is the world's longest-running sporting sponsorship, providing balls for the tournament since 1902.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 Wimbledon was cancelled, the first cancellation of the tournament since World War II. The rescheduled 134th edition was staged from 28 June 2021 to 11 July 2021, following from the 2020 cancellation. The 135th edition was played between 27 June 2022 and 10 July 2022, and regularly scheduled play occurred on the middle Sunday for the first time. It marks the centenary of the inaugural championships staged at the Centre Court. The ATP, ITF, and WTA did not award ranking points for the 2022 tournament, due to controversy over the tournament excluding players representing Russia and Belarus.
The 2023 Wimbledon Championships will be the 136th staging and will run from 3 July 2023 to 16 July 2023 and it will be the first event of King Charles III since the death of the former patron, Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September 2022."

dolly,id836,human,"Abel Janszoon Tasman was a Dutch seafarer and explorer who worked for the Dutch East India Company (VOC). He was born in 1603 in the Netherlands and began his career as a merchant seaman. In 1633, he joined the VOC and sailed to Batavia (now Jakarta, Indonesia), where he participated in several voyages, including one to Japan.

In 1642, Tasman was appointed to lead an expedition to explore the uncharted regions of the Southern Pacific Ocean. He sailed eastward and discovered the west coast of Tasmania, which he named Van Diemen's Land, and the west coast of New Zealand, which he named Staten Landt. However, his expedition was not entirely successful, as he encountered violence with the Māori people on the South Island of New Zealand, resulting in the deaths of four of his men.

Tasman continued to serve the VOC until his death in 1659. He made a second voyage in 1644, during which he mapped the north coast of Australia and made observations on New Holland and its people","Sure, here is summary about Abel Janszoon Tasman:
Abel Janszoon Tasman (Dutch: [ˈɑbəl ˈjɑnsoːn ˈtɑsmɑn]; 1603 – 10 October 1659) was a Dutch seafarer and explorer best known for his voyages of 1642 and 1644 in the service of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). He was appointed by the VOC to explore the uncharted regions of the Southern Pacific Ocean and discovered Van Diemen's Land, Staten Landt, and Nieuw Zeeland. Despite his achievements, his expedition was not entirely successful due to a violent confrontation with the Māori people on the South Island of New Zealand. Nonetheless, his expedition paved the way for further exploration and colonization of Australia and New Zealand by the Europeans. Abel Tasman was born around 1603 in Lutjegast, a small village in the province of Groningen, in the north of the Netherlands.
He served the Dutch East India Company until his death in 1659, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest explorers of his time. He was engaged to marry 21-year-old Jannetje Tjaers, of Palmstraat in the Jordaan district of the city, and took part in a voyage to Seram Island. He was second-in-command of a 1639 expedition of exploration into the north Pacific under Matthijs Quast, which reached Fort Zeelandia and Deshima.
The Council of the Indies dispatched Tasman and Franchoijs Jacobszoon Visscher on a voyage to explore the Provinces of Beach, which had appeared on European maps since the 15th century. Tasman attempted to land in North Bay, but the sea was too rough, so he turned away and continued his continent-hunting.
Tasman and his crew sighted land on the north-west coast of New Zealand, naming it Staten Landt in honour of the States General. Tasman's expedition encountered a group of Māori who attacked four sailors and named the area ""Murderers' Bay"".
Tasman's second voyage was a disappointment for the Dutch East India Company, who decided that a more persistent explorer should be chosen for future expeditions. Tasman's voyage in 1642-43 proved that the small fifth continent was not joined to any larger sixth continent, and his suggestion that New Zealand was the western side of that Southern Continent was seized upon by European cartographers.
Tasmanians have named places after him, including the Tasman Peninsula, Tasman Highway, Tasman Glacier, Tasman Lake, Mount Tasman, and Abel Tasman Monument."

dolly,id865,human,"Chess is a two-player board game where players, White and Black, aim to checkmate their opponent's king by putting it under immediate attack with no escape. The game is played on a 64-square grid with 16 pieces each, and the objective is to outmaneuver the opponent. The game has a long history, with standardized rules emerging in Europe in the 15th century, and today it is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions globally.","Chess is a two player turn based abstract strategy board game with the goal of checkmating the opponents King. The game originated from a similar board game from India called Chatarunga, which was played during the 17th century.
Chess boards have 64 squares arranged into an 8x8 grid with alternating white and black squares. Each player controls 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 bishops, 2 rooks, 2 knights, and eight pawns. Each piece has a predefined mode of movement. Each player's pieces are uniformly colored; for example if player one has the white pieces, player one will start the match. 
Checkmating the opponents king requires the opponent to position their pieces into an attacking arrangement that prohibits the defending players king from moving. This is usually accomplished by closing in on their defending opponents king and systematically working towards positions where the king can no longer move without being taken. If the king is under attack (meaning the king is in a position where the opponents next move will take the king) the defensive player must either take the attacking piece with any piece on the board or move the king to a position where the king is no longer under attach, this configuration is called ""Check"" or being ""Checked"". Chess matches can also end in a draw.
Chess arose in popularity in the 19th century and is governed internationally by the FIDE (international chess federation). Magnus Carlsen is the current world champion (2023) and the game has a huge body of theory associated with playing the game. 
The game has influenced western culture in the fields of art, mathematics, computer science and psychology. Computer scientists have used chess as a method for developing algorithms that can play chess. In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat a human opponent, beating the current world champion Garry Kasparov at that time. Today's chess playing machines are significantly more powerful and have been influenced by the best chess players in the world."

Taking a cue from Thomas Harmer, Francis distinguished the voice of an ""Egyptian Spouse"" from that of a ""Jewish Queen"": in this love triangle, Solomon's marriage to the daughter of Pharaoh being resented by an earlier wife.
Francis's translation has not received much continuing attention. Yet in the verdict of one recent commentator, Francis's ""insistence on bringing together learning and feeling, what she knew as male and female worlds, makes her Song of Songs an outstanding feminist monument.""
In 1787, Francis changed publishers to raise her voice in response to Goethe's ""Charlotte to Werther. A Poetical Epistle"". Throughout the 1790s, she further strengthened the reactionary side of the political divide by periodically publishing work.
Despite Francis's lack of formal education, she aided in efforts to adapt French and German playscripts, as did various other female writers.
Anne Francis died on 7 November 1800, at the age of 62."

By putting the body into difficult positions you achieve several key benefits. The first is you are helping your body heal pain.

2. Hampered batsmen's scoring skills and concentration, according to Ricky Ponting and Greg Chappell.
3. Discouraged players from representing their test cricket national side, with many West Indies players preferring to play in Twenty20 franchises elsewhere for financial gain.
4. Potentially hindered the development of young players' batting and bowling skills, as they may play too much T20 and not focus on Test cricket.","Twenty20 cricket is a shortened game format of cricket. Regardless of a player's role on the team, Twenty20 had ""raised the bar"" in terms of fitness standards for all players by requiring better levels of strength, speed, agility, and reaction time.
Although numerous important commentators, including Adam Gilchrist, have praised the Twenty20 format as a better, faster, and more financially feasible manner of promoting the game of cricket around the world, the format has been criticized by other famous cricketers. Some of the impacts of this format on the game of cricket are: 
1. Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has blamed Twenty20 cricket for harming Test cricket and impairing batsmen's scoring skills and concentration.
2. Former Australian captain Greg Chappell had similar concerns, saying that young players might play too much T20 and not fully develop their batting skills.
3. Former England player feared that bowlers playing only Twenty20 format many not develop bowling skills fully.
4. Former West Indies captains Clive Lloyd, Michael Holding, and Garfield Sobers criticized Twenty20 for its role in discouraging players from playing for their country's test cricket team and instead play in a Twenty20 franchise cricket elsewhere in the world to make more money.

dolly,id901,human,Modern Talking is a German pop music duo consisting of Dieter Bohlen and Thomas Anders.,"First formed in West Berlin in early 1983, they unexpectedly became popular in the beginning of 1985 with ""You're My Heart, You're My Soul"", with which they occupied top ten positions in 35 countries including their homeland where the single perched at the top for six consecutive weeks, the single eventually went on to sell eight million copies worldwide. The track was then followed by another number-one hit, ""You Can Win If You Want"", which was released in the middle of 1985 from the debut album The 1st Album. The album was certified platinum in Germany for selling over 500,000 units.
Soon after their second hit, Modern Talking released the single ""Cheri, Cheri Lady"" which also quickly climbed to the top of the charts in West Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Norway, meanwhile entering the top ten in Sweden and the Netherlands. The single, being the only track released from their second album Let's Talk About Love, managed to push the album to a platinum status in West Germany for sales of over 500,000. The success continued with another two number one singles, ""Brother Louie"" and ""Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. for Love)"", both from the third album, Ready for Romance. The duo also charted high with their sixth single ""Geronimo's Cadillac"" from the fourth album In the Middle of Nowhere, and ""Jet Airliner"" from their fifth album Romantic Warriors.
Due to their lackluster received sixth album, Bohlen announced the end of the project during an interview, while Anders was in Los Angeles. This sparked further animosities between the two, who had had a tumultuous and quarreling relationship even when they were together. According to Bohlen, the main reason for breaking up the group was Anders' then-wife Nora, who refused to have her husband interviewed by female reporters, and constantly demanded huge changes made to shows, videos or recordings, a fact that Anders later admitted in his biography. After a final phone call during which both men heavily insulted each other, they refused to speak with each other for over 10 years.
During this era, Modern Talking were successful in Europe, Asia, South America, the Middle East and in Iran. In the United Kingdom, they entered the top five only once, with the song ""Brother Louie"". In 1985, RCA signed Modern Talking for a US deal and released their first album in the US, but they remained almost unknown in North America, never appearing on the US charts. They released two albums each year between 1985 and 1987, while also promoting their singles on television all over Europe, eventually selling sixty-five million records within three years.
Notably, Modern Talking were one of the first Western bloc bands allowed to sell their records in the Soviet Union. After four decades of Cold War censorship and import restrictions, Mikhail Gorbachev's Glasnost reforms in 1986 opened the Soviet sphere to Western bands, including Modern Talking at the height of their popularity. As a result, they still maintain a large fanbase in Eastern Europe.
Between 1987 and 1997
Immediately after the duo split in mid-1987, Bohlen formed his own project called Blue System and enjoyed several high chart positions, with tracks like ""Sorry Little Sarah"", ""My Bed Is Too Big"", ""Under My Skin"", ""Love Suite"", ""Laila"" and ""Déjà vu"". Meanwhile, Anders went solo, touring under the name of Modern Talking on several continents until the beginning of 1989, when he started to record some of his new pop-like material in LA and London, and also in his native country. Anders recorded five solo albums in English, Different, Whispers, Down on Sunset, When Will I See You Again and Souled, and one of his albums was also recorded in Spanish Barcos de Cristal. He was more successful in foreign countries than his own country, yet he also reached several hits in Germany. Despite all the quarrels and disagreements that Bohlen and Anders got into with each other in the past, they began staying in touch again after Anders moved back to Koblenz, Germany in 1994.
1998–2003: Reunion
In the beginning of 1998, the duo reunited and had their first performance together in March on the German TV show Wetten, dass..?. They released a remixed version of their 1984 single ""You're My Heart, You're My Soul"", which features Eric Singleton on the rap vocals. Their first comeback album Back for Good, which included four new tracks, as well as all of the previous hits remixed with modern techniques, stayed at number one in Germany for five consecutive weeks and managed to top the charts in fifteen countries, eventually selling three million copies in Europe alone. The duo won the award for Best Selling German Band at the World Music Awards that year. The follow-up album Alone also went straight to number one in Germany and was very successful elsewhere; the album managed to sell over one million units in Europe alone.
Bohlen and Anders followed the 1980s Modern Talking pattern as they chose to release two singles from each album, as in the past. A series of singles and four more albums followed such as Year of the Dragon, America, Victory and Universe. After reaching the point where they had already collected over 400 gold and platinum awards worldwide, Bohlen and Anders decided to disband again in 2003 just before the release of another best-of compilation. The second break-up seemed to have been triggered mainly from the negative portrayal of Anders by Bohlen written in his autobiography published on 4 October 2003. In the course of all the disputes which eventually drove the duo to its break-up, Bohlen was involved in Deutschland sucht den Superstar (DSDS), the German edition of the UK's Pop Idol. The compilation album was released in 2003 entitled The Final Album which contained all of the duo's singles. Thomas Anders started another solo career immediately after the end of Modern Talking, while Bohlen had by now begun devoting most of his time to new talents, especially those he discovered on DSDS."

It describes how large incumbent companies lose market share by listening to their customers and providing what appears to be the highest-value products, but new companies that serve low-value customers with poorly developed technology can improve that technology incrementally until it is good enough to quickly take market share from established business. Christensen recommends that large companies maintain small, nimble divisions that attempt to replicate this phenomenon internally to avoid being blindsided and overtaken by startup competitors."

The story revolves around a small train engine that is tasked with transporting toys from one place to another. Despite being small and facing numerous challenges, the engine perseveres and repeats the phrase ""I think I can, I think I can"" to motivate itself.

The book has become a classic and is widely recognized as a valuable teaching tool for children.

The main character is the ""Little Engine"".  The Little Engine is an undersized locomotive that is called upon to pull rail cars full of good things for the boys and girls that live on the other side of the mountain.  Several other locomotives, appearing newer, stronger or more mature than the Little Engine all make excuses for why they will not help take the train cars over the mountain.
The Little Engine gladly takes on the task when called upon.  When starting to pull the heavy rail cars, The Little Engine strains with all its might and begins to say, ""I think I can, I think I can, I think I can.""  When climbing the mountain, it doesn't look like the Little Engine has the power to get over the peak.  The Little Engine puffs, ""I think I can, I think I can, I think I can.""

Toothpaste is used to promote oral hygiene: it is an abrasive that aids in removing dental plaque and food from the teeth, assists in suppressing halitosis, and delivers active ingredients (most commonly fluoride) to help prevent tooth decay (dental caries) and gum disease (gingivitis). Owing to differences in composition and fluoride content, not all toothpastes are equally effective in maintaining oral health. The decline of tooth decay during the 20th century has been attributed to the introduction and regular use of fluoride-containing toothpastes worldwide. Large amounts of swallowed toothpaste can be toxic. Common colors for toothpaste include white (sometimes with colored stripes or green tint) and blue.

1990s-2000s: AI research continued, but the field was criticized for its lack of progress. Researchers argued for a new approach, and the field began to be used successfully in the technology industry.
2010s: The field of AI experienced a resurgence, driven by access to large amounts of data,","The 1956 Dartmouth workshop was the moment that AI gained its name, its mission, its first success and its major players, and is widely considered the birth of AI. In the 1970s, AI was subject to critiques and financial setbacks. AI researchers had failed to appreciate the difficulty of the problems they faced. In the 1980s a form of AI program called ""expert systems"" was adopted by corporations around the world and knowledge became the focus of mainstream AI research. In the first decades of the 21st century, access to large amounts of data (known as ""big data""), cheaper and faster computers and advanced machine learning techniques were successfully applied to many problems throughout the economy. By 2016, advances in deep learning (particularly deep convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks) drove progress and research in image and video processing, text analysis, and even speech recognition."

Dubbed the ""King of Pop"", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot.
The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his public debut in 1964 with his older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. He became a solo star with his 1979 album Off the Wall. His music videos, including those for ""Beat It"", ""Billie Jean"", and ""Thriller"" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an artform and promotional tool. He helped propel the success of MTV and continued to innovate with videos for the albums Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995), and Invincible (2001). Thriller became the best-selling album of all time, while Bad was the first album to produce five US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles.
From the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior, and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of civil court; Jackson was not indicted due to lack of evidence. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. The FBI found no evidence of criminal conduct by Jackson in either case. In 2009, while he was preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray, who was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter. His death triggered reactions around the world, creating unprecedented surges of Internet traffic and a spike in sales of his music. A televised memorial service for Jackson, held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, was viewed by more than an estimated 2.5 billion people globally.
Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 400 million records worldwide.
He had 13 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles (third highest of any artist in the Hot 100 era) and was the first artist to have a top-ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. His honors include 15 Grammy Awards, 6 Brit Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and 39 Guinness World Records, including the ""Most Successful Entertainer of All Time"".

dolly,id1115,human,"Here's a simple example:

Imagine you're listening to a vinyl record and you hear a song that sounds like it's being played on a flute. But, if you look closely at the record player, you'll see that the needle is actually moving up and down to create a sound that's similar to a trumpet. This is because the record player is only able to capture a certain range of frequencies (like the flute sound) and not others (like the trumpet sound). When you listen to the record, your brain fills in the gaps and you hear the sound as a trumpet, even though it's actually just a flute-like sound being manipulated by the record player. This is similar to what happens with aliasing in signal processing, where the sampling rate (like the record player's needle) can't capture the full range of frequencies, causing different signals to become distorted or ""aliased"" as one another.","An example of aliasing that easy to understand as a layman is the 'wagon wheel effect'. You've probably seen the wagon wheel effect when watching a movie or tv show and the wheels of a car appear to be spinning backwards even as the car moves forwards. This is an effect of aliasing. This occurs because the sampling rate of the film is not adequate to capture the frequency of the signal (the frequency that the tires are spinning forwards) and the signal becomes indistinguishable from another signal (a frequency of the tires spinning backwards). As an example of how this happens imagine that the camera's sampling rate allows it to record an image frame at about 90% of the frequency that the tires are spinning. That is, the tire is spinning fast enough that it rotates 90% around in between each picture the camera can take. In this case, the wheel will look like its rotated backwards by 10% of a rotation on each image. When you put these images together in a film, the tires will appear to be rotating backwards."

dolly,id1155,human,"Here's a summary of the Dunning-Kruger effect:

The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias where people with low ability or expertise overestimate their ability or knowledge.
It's often misunderstood as a claim about general overconfidence of people with low intelligence, but it's actually about specific overconfidence in a particular task or area.
The effect is typically measured by comparing self-assessment with objective performance, and it appears in both relative and absolute terms.
The original study found that the bottom quartile of performers tend to see themselves as being part of the top two quartiles.
Many models have been suggested to explain the effect, including a lack of metacognitive abilities, regression toward the mean, overly positive prior beliefs, difficulty in self-assessment, and lack of incentive to give accurate self-assessments.
The Dunning-Kruger effect has been linked to inaccurate self-assessment, which can lead to bad decisions and inhibit personal growth.
However, it may also have positive side effects, such as increasing motivation and energy.","The Dunning-Kruger effect refers to the tendency for people to over-estimate their ability to perform a particular task, particular if they are low-skilled at that task.  Related research suggests that the converse is also true; high-skills performers tend to underestimate their ability.  The effect was validated through a number of studies covering a range of skills, though the cause of the effect is still a matter of debate.  Similarly, the practical implications of the effect is debatable, as over-confidence stemming from an inaccurate self-assessments can have positive and negative impacts."

Designed by Danish architect Jorn Utzon, but completed by an Australian architectural team headed by Peter Hall, the building was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973 after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.

It began with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, 23 per cent of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered 35.5 million km2 (13.7 million sq mi), 24 per cent of the Earth's total land area.

The Mughal imperial structure, however, is sometimes dated to 1600, to the rule of Babur's grandson, Akbar. This imperial structure lasted until 1720, shortly after the death of the last major emperor, Aurangzeb, during whose reign the empire also achieved its maximum geographical extent. Reduced subsequently to the region in and around Old Delhi by 1760, the empire was formally dissolved by the British Raj after the Indian Rebellion of 1857."

Another option could be to use a LED strip with a diffuser or a frosted cover to soften the light and create a more ambient glow. This would help to reduce the harshness of the light and make it less distracting.

It's also worth considering the color temperature of the LED strip. A warm white or soft pink could add a cozy and inviting ambiance to the plaque, while a cool white or blue could create a more modern and sleek look.

Ultimately, the decision of how to diffuse the LED strip will depend on the overall aesthetic you're trying to achieve and the purpose of the light. But by considering these factors and experimenting with different options, you should be able to create a beautiful and eye-catching display that showcases your animal head plaque.",".  Think Bar rope lights.

If you are going eye-catcher but want subtle, don't put it on the front.  Make the mount so it stands off the wall an inch or so and angle the led strip outward and back so it illuminates the WALL around the plaque.  That would draw attention to it but not make it an in-your-face light making it hard to look into.  Here is the wall effect I am thinking:

Another option is to edge light plexi.  You would put a plexiglas plate between the head and the wood plate and edge light the plexiglass.  The plexi could be routed (standard router) with a design or if you have a laser cutter, plexi is extremely easy to cut and etch, expecially with a CO2 laser.

Yusunoha: Thank you for your reply and all the information. 
To quickly summarize the project that I have in mind, I have a giraffe animal head that I want to put on a plaque, and make it look like the imguraffe. Imgur is about the color green, so I had the idea of adding LED's to the plague that you can set to green.

The effect what I'm trying to go after though is having the head be illuminated in a dark room. Having the back of the plague is an option I considered, but I wanted to focus the light on the head than rather on the plague. And by diffusing the light you will not be directly staring into the light.

I had not considered the edge lit option, I'll take it into consideration, but I think it may be a step too far for me.

A mini cut can indeed last anywhere from 4-6 weeks, but the duration really depends on your individual progress and goals. If you're looking to maintain a flat stomach and visible abs, I'd recommend aiming for at least 8-12 weeks of a mini cut. This will give you enough time to lose the excess fat and reveal the muscle definition you've been working towards.

As for lean bulking, it's a great way to build muscle and strength while minimizing fat gain. The key is to create a calorie surplus that's small enough to support muscle growth, but not so large that you end up gaining too much fat. A surplus of 100-300 calories is a good starting point, but you may need to adjust this based on your individual needs and progress.

When you're in a calorie surplus, your body is in an anabolic state, meaning it's more receptive to building muscle. By keeping your surplus small, you can still support muscle growth while minimizing fat gain. This is achieved by making sure you're eating enough protein to support muscle growth, and also ensuring you're getting enough rest and recovery time.

In terms of training, lean bulking is all about focusing on compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once. This includes exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench press, and rows. These exercises will help you build muscle mass and strength, while also helping you burn fat and reveal the muscle definition you're looking for.

It's also important to note that lean bulking is a long-term process that requires patience and consistency. You can't expect to see results overnight, but with consistent training and nutrition, you can make steady progress towards your goals.

In your case, since you're currently in a calorie surplus of 200-400 calories, I'd recommend trying to reduce your surplus to 100-300 calories. This will help you transition into a lean bulking phase, where you can focus on building muscle and strength while minimizing fat gain. Remember to keep your protein intake high, and make sure you're getting enough rest and recovery time to support muscle growth.

By following these guidelines and being patient, you can achieve the results you're looking for and reveal the muscle definition you've been working towards."," stay away from processed foods however I defiently could do way better.
Bhav2112: Yes, a mini cut is 4-6 weeks. Just try to focus on having a flat stomach and make sure the love handles are under control. Visible abs are not a requirement according to me. 

In terms of lean bulking keep the surplus low 200calories should be fine. You keep at it and see the progress, make changes on the way as you think fit (depends upon energy levels, strength in the gym etc). You can definitely build muscle over such a caloric surplus, but you've gotta track the intake. Because it's a more meticulous approach than just chugging down food, it takes discipline. 

Also watch Jeff nippard's videos on both the subjects of lean bulking and mini cut. You'll get a good idea of how to proceed from there on.
hobo2166: Yes I'm not too worried about having visible abs but having a flat stomach and love handles like you said.

So do you think I should also track macros? Tbh I dont see myself doing this because of my lifestyle (live with parents, dont cook food etc.) What are you're thoughts on the calorie calculators? Are they pretty accurate? For me personally this part confuses me a little because there's many takes on it. Lastly is 0.5-1.0 lb a week a reasonable amount of weight gain?

I'll make sure to watch it, I think I plan on bulking a little more until June then doing a mini cut for 4-6 weeks. Would some cardio hurt btw? Or would the deficit be too big? Sorry for all these questions btw lol I am decently informed in calisthenics but not so much diet.
Bhav2112: Yes track macros, use apps like my fitness pal etc. The main aim of tracking those calories is to educate yourself, after tracking for a while the numbers will start coming to your head instantly and tracking won't be necessary after that. The weight range you've mentioned is an acceptable number. With lean bulking you might be gaining on the lower end though which is fine. 

Cardio never hurts, keeps the heart healthy. You can try and do high intensity cardio. The deficit won't get too big. If you are weighing yourself each day, you'll see how much you are losing in a week. After you arrive at that number, you may cut or add calories or cardio as required. 

It all sounds very daunting and it is in the beginning. After you've had some experience, all of this becomes easier. Track everything for a month and you'll have a lifetime of tracking experience.

This recognition was further solidified with the 1975 Aboriginal Land Rights Act, which gave Aboriginal people the right to claim land and establish native title. Since then, there has been a growing movement to recognize and celebrate Aboriginal Australian identity, with many initiatives and programs aimed at promoting cultural awareness and understanding.

In recent years, there has been a significant shift towards acknowledging and respecting Aboriginal Australian identity, with many institutions and organizations making efforts to incorporate Indigenous perspectives and histories into their work. For example, many schools and universities have introduced Indigenous studies programs, and there has been a growing trend towards Indigenous-led research and community engagement.

This is still in use today.
Various factors affect Aboriginal people's self-identification as Aboriginal, including a growing pride in culture, solidarity in a shared history of dispossession (including the Stolen Generations), and, among those are fair-skinned, an increased willingness to acknowledge their ancestors, once considered shameful.

As the volume and complexity of data continue to grow, the need for sophisticated data management and analytics tools becomes increasingly pressing. However, the reliance on ""big data"" approaches has also led to the development of new forms of data inequality, where those with access to the most advanced technologies and computational resources hold significant advantages over those who do not. Furthermore, the emphasis on ""big data"" has also led to a neglect of other important forms of data, such as qualitative and contextual data, which are often more relevant to understanding complex social and cultural phenomena.

In order to move beyond the limitations of ""big data"" and to achieve a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the world, it is essential to develop new approaches that integrate multiple forms of data and that prioritize the complexity and richness of human experience. This requires a shift away from the dominant paradigm of ""big data"" and towards a more inclusive and participatory approach to data collection and analysis.

It sheds light on the gap between analogue or augmented digital practices and fully computational ones, and the strategies researchers have developed to deal with this gap.

sad,id1005,human,", the complexity of biological systems requires the development of novel theoretical and computational tools to tackle the challenges of modeling, analysis, and simulation. Hybrid systems, which combine continuous and discrete components, offer a promising approach to tackle these challenges. They can be used to model and analyze the behavior of biological systems at multiple scales, from the molecular to the organismal level. The workshop aimed at bringing together researchers from different fields, including systems biology, computer science, and engineering, to discuss the latest advances and challenges in the development of hybrid systems for biological applications. The contributions presented in this volume demonstrate the diversity of topics and approaches being explored in this field, from the development of new mathematical and computational tools to the application of hybrid systems to specific biological problems, such as signal processing, gene regulation, and disease modeling.",", an important open problem is finding appropriate computational models that scale well for both simulation and formal analysis of biological processes. Hybrid modeling techniques, combining discrete and continuous processes, are gaining more and more attention in such a context, and they have been successfully applied to capture the behavior of many biological complex systems, ranging from genetic networks, biochemical reactions, signaling pathways, cardiac tissues electro-physiology, and tumor genesis. This workshop aims at bringing together researchers in computer science, mathematics, and life sciences, interested in the opportunities and the challenges of hybrid modeling applied to systems biology. The workshop programme included the keynote presentation of Alessandro Astolfi (Imperial College of London, UK) on Immune response enhancement via hybrid control. Furthermore, 8 papers were selected out of 13 submissions by the Program Committee of HSB 2013. The papers in this volume address the hybrid modeling of a number important biological processes (iron homeostasis network, mammalian cell cycle, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), genetic regulatory network in mammalian sclera) and, the formalisms and techniques for specifying and validating properties of biological systems (such as, robustness, oscillations)."
sad,id463,human," disagreements on the definition of ""water"" itself, such as whether it's liquid, gas, or plasma. Additionally, there might be disputes over the specific conditions required for the experiment, like the pressure, temperature, and containment methods. These uncertainties can lead to vastly different results, making it challenging to draw meaningful conclusions.

Furthermore, the article's claims of achieving 200°C water under normal conditions are highly suspicious. Water's boiling point is well-established at 100°C at standard atmospheric pressure, and any claims of exceeding this without some sort of external assistance, such as high pressure or exotic materials, seem far-fetched.

It's also worth noting that the article's authors might be using a different definition of ""water"" or ""temperature"" than the scientific community is familiar with. For instance, they might be referring to a specific type of water molecule or a particular phase of water that's not commonly recognized.

In any case, without further evidence and peer-reviewed validation, the claims made in this article should be taken with a grain of salt. It's essential to approach such sensational headlines with a healthy dose of skepticism and a critical eye, rather than getting caught up in the hype and excitement surrounding them."," things such as what constitutes a finite closed environment vs. an effectively infinite closed environment and how good those approximations are.

Mostly though, it's very problematic to claim strong results without a demonstrated mechanism (i.e. one that can be repeatedly shown to be sufficient and necessary via controlled experiment). The dissolved gas explanation is somewhat close in this aspect, but still seems to suffer from repeatability concerns.
Panzerdrek: So... Sounds like you agree there's some uncertainty here and this is actually a difficult problem experimentally. In other words not bullshit but a valid empirical question based on confusing experimental results.
Ularsing: Only if you think [green jellybeans cause acne](https://xkcd.com/882/).

Mostly this strikes me as another example of overattributing (mythologizing) the accomplishments and scientific understanding of early scientists and philosophers. See also: Archimedes death ray, Tesla's unproven oscillator and long distance wireless power transmission, etc.

This is in part due to the [halo fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect), but there also appears to be an intrinsic appeal for many in the mysticism of believing that the right special someone at any time could tap into some unknown secret of the universe, which is how magic apocryphally works, but not so much modern science. I think that notion is comforting to some because it supports a Dunning-Kreuger-friendly perception of science where discoveries are made and unmade over the years, with the wisdom of the ancients holding secrets that may have since been lost to modernity (this also underlies TCM, Reiki, and other ""alternative medicine""). That's comforting in that it offers a reassuring alternative to the overwhelming exponential pace of scientific advancement. This ""wisdom of the ancients"" fallacy (I'm not aware of an official name for it, though it seems like [rationalwiki has settled upon something similar](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Appeal_to_ancient_wisdom)) was also at the core of the infamous *Ancient Aliens*.

I'm not saying that this research is in the same vein as perpetual motion and cold fusion, but the public interest in it may very well be. It has most of the hallmarks of a good myth. Generally, when an effect is hard/impossible to replicate and has no clear theoretical explanation, that's not a great sign for it being real.

The observations were carried out in a coordinated effort between the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor, the Swift X-Ray Telescope, and the GROND instrument. The prompt emission of these gamma-ray bursts was characterized by Fermi/LAT, which detected the bursts and provided precise positions for follow-up observations. The Swift X-Ray Telescope then observed the afterglows of the bursts in the X-ray band, providing further information on the energy budget and host galaxy properties.

The GROND instrument, mounted on the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope, observed the afterglows of the bursts in the optical and near-infrared bands, providing information on the dust extinction and the host galaxy properties. The 2-meter telescope at the La Silla Observatory also observed the afterglow of GRB090323 in the optical band, providing further information on the burst's properties.

The multi-wavelength follow-up observations of these gamma-ray bursts have provided a wealth of information on the prompt emission and afterglow properties of these energetic events. The observations have also facilitated comparison with pre-Fermi bursts, providing new insights into the physics of gamma-ray bursts and their role in the universe. The Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor and the Swift X-Ray Telescope continue to monitor the gamma-ray sky for new bursts, providing opportunities for further multi-wavelength follow-up observations and the determination of the properties of these energetic events."," m telescope in Tautenburg, Germany. Three of the events are classified as long bursts while GRB090510 is a well localized short GRB with GeV emission. In addition, host galaxies were detected for three of the four bursts. Spectroscopic follow-up was initiated with the VLT for GRB090328 and GRB090510. The afterglow observations in 7 bands are presented for all bursts and their host galaxies are investigated. Knowledge of the distance and the local dust extinction enables comparison of the afterglows of LAT-detected GRBs with the general sample. The spectroscopic redshifts of GRB090328 and GRB090510 were determined to be z=0.7354+/-0.0003 and z=0.903 +/- 0.001 and dust corrected star-formation rates of 4.8 Mdot yr^-1 and 0.60 M_dot yr^-1 were derived for their host galaxies, respectively. The afterglows of long bursts exhibit power-law decay indices alpha from less than 1 to ~2.3 and spectral indices (beta) values from 0.65 to ~1.2 which are fairly standard for GRB afterglows. Constraints are placed on the jet half opening angles of less than 2.1 deg to greater than 6.4 deg which allows limits to be placed on the beaming corrected energies. These range from less than 5x10^50 erg to the one of the highest values ever recorded, greater than 2.2x10^52 erg for GRB090902B, and are not consistent with a standard candle. The extremely energetic long Fermi bursts have optical afterglows which lie in the top half of the brightness distribution of all optical afterglows detected in the Swift era or even in the top 5% if incompleteness is considered. The properties of the host galaxies of these LAT detected bursts in terms of extinction, star formation rates and masses do not appear to differ from previous samples."

I've already disassembled the speakers and removed the grills, and I'm trying to figure out how to remove the trim ring. It's like it's glued or something, and I'm not sure how to get it off without damaging it. Do you have any other suggestions or tips for me?

jonvon65: Yeah, the trim ring can be a pain to remove. You might want to try using a hair dryer to heat it up and then gently prying it off with a flathead screwdriver. Just be careful not to apply too much pressure, or you might damage the surrounding plastic. Another option is to use a trim removal tool, which is specifically designed for this type of thing. You can find them at most electronics stores or online. If you're not comfortable using one of those, you could also try soaking the trim ring in some warm water for a few minutes to loosen the adhesive. Just be sure to dry it off thoroughly before trying to remove it.

2LateImDead: That's a great idea about the hair dryer! I'll definitely try that. I've also been thinking about using some kind of adhesive remover, like Goo Gone or WD-40, but I'm not sure if that would work or if it would damage the plastic. Do you think that would be a good idea?

jonvon65: I would advise against using any kind of adhesive remover on the trim ring. Those chemicals can be harsh and might damage the plastic or leave residue behind. Instead, I would stick with the hair dryer method or try using a trim removal tool. If you're still having trouble, you could also try using a plastic scraper or a credit card to gently pry the trim ring off. Just be careful not to apply too much pressure, or you might damage the surrounding plastic.

2LateImDead: Okay, I'll try the hair dryer method and see if that works. Thanks for the advice, I really appreciate it. I'll also try to find a trim removal tool online and see if that makes it easier to remove the trim ring. I'll keep you updated on my progress and let you know if I have any other questions or need any further assistance.

If you have any other questions or need any more advice, feel free to ask."," ago), but I've got no money to do so.  Either someone gives them to me or I manage to fix what I've got, else I've got nothing to work with.  :/

If I pry the grill off without damaging it, would normal superglue be good enough to put them back on so they don't look like crap?
jonvon65: Ahh, I see. The issue isn't getting the speakers open as much as fixing the blown drivers themselves. I haven't heard many success stories of blown drivers being restored. The only spare speakers I have are little mid rangers from my car (one of them pops when turned too loud but otherwise works fine). I would send them to you but they're 2.75 inches in diameter which is a lot smaller than the ones you have. Normal superglue probably wouldn't adhere that well to the front grills because it's a little too thin. Thicker glue like hot glue or gorilla glue would be better for this situation.
2LateImDead: I might be able to get some Gorilla glue if it's even fixable.  Probably isn't though, like you said.  Thanks for the offer of those speakers from your car.  I'm pretty sure they're actually about the size of these ones - I shone a light through the mesh to look inside and these things are like 90% casing, the speaker inside is fairly small.  I don't have any exact measurements, though.

Do you have an estimate of how much it'd cost to mail them?  I live in Virginia.  I don't really have any money because my job sucks and I'm going through college and supporting myself, but I could skip paying my phone bill this month to cover shipping costs, potentially.  But I can't imagine they'd be huge, even shipping from Asia is normally no more than $10, if it's something reasonably small.
jonvon65: Honestly, don't worry about the shipping, I've got you covered. I'm testing them out right now and they're not half bad. Also they're just bare speakers and I'd like to put them in an enclosure of some sort before I ship them. What would you be hooking them up to?
2LateImDead: I've got an old Sony amplifier that uses the basic black and red speaker wires to hook things up.  It's also got RCA (yellow-white-red, minus the yellow since it's just audio) outputs and inputs.  I've got an AUX-RCA adapter to input sound.  I've never used the RCA outputs but I'm under the impression that they'd work the same, so whatever is easiest for you.

Thanks a bunch, by the way.  I've been really stressed about not having any speakers.  I'll still need to find more, but getting back 2 when I lost 4 cuts the loss in half, which is a big help.  And even 2 is enough to get back to practicing and recording.  :)

I'll send you a PM with my address.
jonvon65: Ahh ok, good, that makes it easy then! Of course, just letting you know beforehand that these speakers are good quality but they are rather small, you won't be pissing off the neighbors with them. That being said, just don't turn them up too loud and you should be fine. I'll start on building the enclosures tomorrow and hopefully I can get them shipped out to you sometime this week. You're welcome!

As we watched, the lions seemed to be savoring their meal, taking their time to enjoy the fresh kill. The hyenas, on the other hand, were more focused on devouring as much as they could, their scavenging instincts taking over. It was a stark reminder of the circle of life, where predators and prey coexisted in a delicate balance.

The experience left a lasting impression on me, and I've always been drawn to the wild and its raw power. As I grew older, I began to appreciate the complexity of the ecosystem, the intricate relationships between species, and the resilience of life in the face of death.

Years later, when I heard about the spotted hyenas attacking the Kudu in the safari resort foyer, I couldn't help but think back to my own experience. The memory of the lions and hyenas came flooding back, and I was struck by the realization that, despite the differences in setting and circumstances, the primal power of nature remained unchanged.

It's a reminder that, no matter where we are in the world, we are all part of a larger ecosystem, connected to the land and its creatures in ways both subtle and profound. And for those who venture into the wild, there's always the possibility of encountering the raw and unbridled power of nature, a power that can be both awe-inspiring and humbling."," cubs...

TryingDrying: Failed environmental vegan here!

I want to hunt because of the morality &amp; sustainability.
Spoonloops: I don’t think it would be sustainable if everyone started hunting with our current population though.
TryingDrying: If you look at the stats, as long as hunters were following sustainable practices, it would greatly reduce environmental damage. Of course, we can't just go hunting populations to extinction as we've done in the past (see: carrier pigeons, etc.).


 It would be a part of environmental management -- culling and the like. Also, the hunting input is a much higher barrier than going to the grocery store. Either by practical capacity or prep-induced respect, I think people would appreciate the sanctity of life more &amp; eat less meat. 

For the most part, hunters use all parts of the animal. You also contend with population regeneration and are forced to modulate habits accordingly.
Spoonloops: You’re probably right. Would need a cultural overall on eating less meat for sure. Wouldn’t be a bad thing either way.

One of the most promising targets was a star with a known cool companion that was estimated to be around 20 Jupiter masses. The simulations predicted that the companion would be bright enough to be detectable, and indeed, our observations confirmed the presence of a faint companion. Further analysis revealed that the companion was a brown dwarf with a mass of around 15 Jupiter masses, which is consistent with the predictions made by the simulations. This detection provides a unique opportunity to study the properties of a cool companion in detail, and we are currently conducting a thorough analysis of the data to determine the companion's properties.

The detection of this brown dwarf companion also has implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems. The fact that this companion is a brown dwarf suggests that it may have formed in a similar way to the planets in our own solar system, and therefore, it could provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Furthermore, the detection of this companion highlights the importance of continued efforts to directly image cool companions, as it provides a unique opportunity to study the properties of these objects in detail.

In conclusion, our adaptive optics imaging program has successfully detected a cool companion to a solar-type star, providing a unique opportunity to study the properties of a brown dwarf in detail. The detection of this companion has implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems, and it highlights the importance of continued efforts to directly image cool companions. We are currently conducting a thorough analysis of the data to determine the companion's properties, and we are excited to see what further insights this detection may provide."," of radial-velocity detected exoplanets with consistent velocity fits and age estimates could potentially be directly imaged using the VLT's Simultaneous Differential Imaging system and only under favorable conditions. We also present detectability confidence limits from the radial-velocity data sets and show how these can be used to gain a better understanding of these systems when combined with the imaging data. For HD32778 and HD91204 the detectabilities help little in constraining the companion and hence almost all our knowledge is drawn from the SDI images. Therefore, we can say that these stars do not host cool methane objects, out to on-sky separations of ~2'', with contrasts less than 10-11 magnitudes. However, for HD25874, HD120780 and HD145825, the contrasts and detectabilities can rule out a number of possible solutions, particularly at low angular separations, and for the best case, down to strong methane masses of 40MJ at 1'' separation. The contrast curves constructed for these five stars show 5 sigma contrasts (Delta F1) of ~9.2-11.5 magnitudes at separations of >/=0.6'', which correspond to contrasts of ~9.7-12.0 magnitudes for companions of mid-T spectral type. Such limits allow us to reach down to 40MJ around fairly old field dwarfs that typically constitute high precision radial-velocity programs. Finally, the analysis performed here can serve as a template for future projects that will employ extreme-AO systems to directly image planets already indirectly discovered by the radial-velocity method."

In particular, we find that the spectrum is composed of a finite number of bands, each of which is a union of a finite number of connected components, and that the width of each band is exponentially small in N. This result has important implications for the study of the dynamics of the Anosov diffeomorphism, as it provides a precise description of the behavior of the transfer operator in the limit N->infinity.

Furthermore, we also study the properties of the prequantum transfer operator in the case where the symplectic form is not exact, but rather a closed 2-form. In this case, we show that the spectrum of the prequantum transfer operator is still composed of a finite number of bands, but the width of each band is not exponentially small in N. Instead, we find that the width of each band is bounded away from zero, and that the spectrum is dense in a certain region of the complex plane.

The prequantization of a symplectic Anosov diffeomorphism is a fundamental object of study in symplectic geometry and dynamical systems, and has applications to a wide range of fields, including geometry, topology, and physics. The study of the spectral properties of the prequantum transfer operator is an active area of research, and our results provide new insights into the behavior of this operator in the limit N->infinity.

In addition, our results have implications for the study of the dynamics of Anosov diffeomorphisms, and provide a new tool for understanding the behavior of these diffeomorphisms in the limit of large N. This is particularly important in the study of geodesic flows on negatively curved manifolds, where the prequantization of the flow is a fundamental object of study.

We show that, with the special (H\""older continuous) potential V0=1/2 log |det Df_x|_{E_u}|, the outermost annulus is the unit circle and separated from the other parts. For this, we use an extension of the transfer operator to the Grassmanian bundle. Using Atiyah-Bott trace formula, we establish the Gutzwiller trace formula with exponentially small reminder for large time. We show also that, for a potential V such that the outermost annulus is separated from the other parts, most of the eigenvalues in the outermost annulus concentrate on a circle of radius exp where <.> denotes the spatial average on M. The number of these eigenvalues is given by the ""Weyl law"", that is, N^d.Vol(M) with d=1/2. dim(M) in the leading order. We develop a semiclassical calculus associated to the prequantum operator by defining quantization of observables Op(psi) in an intrinsic way. We obtain that the semiclassical Egorov formula of quantum transport is exact. We interpret all these results from a physical point of view as the emergence of quantum dynamics in the classical correlation functions for large time. We compare these results with standard quantization (geometric quantization) in quantum chaos."

FL-Irish: Re: the old friends, the whole hard drugs/alcoholic scene are pretty toxic in general, and extremely bad for young families, so if they're heading in that direction you need to REALLY limit how often you see these friends. (as you have with the one who's on drugs) Maybe be there for them in a pinch, but it doesn't even sound like you're enjoying hanging out with the alcoholic one. I don't think you're judging them as human beings. I think you're just protecting your normal life from stuff that has the potential to drag you down. 

So moving on, it's hard to assess your situation. You say a few things have fallen through -- that's pretty common in the adult world, honestly, where everyone is busy with life. So, to go from that to a possible idea of being ""bipolar?"" That's quite the jump! Do you have any reason to suspect mental health issues? If so, it might be worth making a one-off appointment with a counselor just to discuss that. Anyway, hard to judge from what you've said. 

So I'd continue to reach out to the acquaintances. Something like, ""Hey, the wife and I are considering doing X this weekend. Any chance you guys would like to join us?""

If the answer is they can't, then just say, ""No problem, maybe some other time!"" Keep the energy and enthusiasm level high. You don't want to be giving off negative or disappointed vibes. Check in by text at least once a week.

At the same, don't invest all your eggs in this one social basket. If there are other couples who have potential, make it a habit to reach out and mention potential things you could do together. A picnic. A show. A barbecue. Go out for dinner. A movie. A farmers market. Go to the gym or the dog park. Hit a garage sale. 

It's easier to make friends when you've got more than one thing going on, and you can issue casual invitations that don't seem high pressure. ""Oh, we're doing this if you're interested. Let us know!""

Don't get discouraged. I think you're on the right track. Good luck!

As the debate continued, a gentle soul named Emma, a professional barber with a heart of gold, decided to step in and share her own experience with cutting hair for children with autism. She had worked with several children with autism, and she knew that with patience, understanding, and the right techniques, she could make the experience enjoyable and stress-free for them.

Emma explained that she had developed a special technique for cutting hair that involved using soft, gentle strokes and taking her time to ensure that the child felt comfortable and relaxed throughout the process. She also made sure to communicate clearly and calmly, using simple language and avoiding sudden movements that might startle the child.

One of the most important things Emma emphasized was the importance of building trust with the child. She would take the time to get to know the child, learn about their likes and dislikes, and find ways to make them feel at ease. She believed that by establishing a strong bond with the child, she could help them feel more confident and less anxious during the haircut.

Emma's approach had been incredibly successful, and she had received glowing reviews from parents and children alike. She had even started a program at her shop specifically designed for children with autism, where she and her team would work together to create a safe and welcoming environment for these special young people.

As the discussion continued, Emma's words of wisdom and experience inspired others to share their own stories and insights. They talked about the importance of understanding and patience, and how these qualities could make all the difference in the world for a child with autism.

One of the most moving stories shared was that of a young boy named Max, who had been refused service at several barber shops due to his autism. Max's parents had been devastated by the experience, but they had refused to give up. They had searched far and wide for a barber who could help their son, and finally, they had found Emma.

Emma had taken Max under her wing, and with her help, he had learned to feel comfortable and confident in the barber shop. Max had even started to look forward to his haircuts, and his parents had seen a significant improvement in his overall well-being.

As the conversation came to a close, it was clear that there was still much to be learned and shared about cutting hair for children with autism. But one thing was certain: with the right approach, patience, and understanding, even the most challenging situations could be overcome."," follicles they walked in with and a bloody scalp.
Shellphon3: Lol as if an electric razor isnt a common tool for hair cuts.  I specifically didnt commit to safety scissors.
Chaotross: You're confusing an electric razor with clippers, dude. No barber uses an electric razor, at that point there's no point in getting the license. You also can't use electric clippers with kids with autism at first.
Shellphon3: Its true i am confusing them, why cant you use clippers on a kid with autism though?  They probably wont like the sound but they wouldnt get hurt.
Chaotross: Kids with autism don't simply ""not like sounds"". They get sensory overload very easily and can get themselves hurt badly from their reactions.
Shellphon3: Unless you provide some specifics,  all i see is you placing more emphasis on the same thing i said.
Chaotross: Except I countered what you said, saying they would in fact get hurt. Autistic children can have a complete breakdown from certain sensory input, a common one is irritating buzzing noises and the feeling of clippers over the head. Autism is a spectrum of symptoms, I can't say one specific reaction or symptom every child with autism will have. Look up some information yourself, man.
Shellphon3: If you want to posit that children will be hurt by clippers cite an instance of something like that happening, I dont know how you think the burden lies on me to fact check you.
Chaotross: Because you claimed you could cut anyone's hair out of nowhere with zero issue without any training even as a barber. I am countering your claim, the burden of proof is on you. You're being willfully ignorant.

however, [here](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-39502366) is a similar article where a child had to be physically restrained while screaming before he found a barber that works with autistic and terminally ill children. If he wasn't physically restrained he would've injured himself.
Shellphon3: Clippers wont cut a kid,  and outside of kids who fall out of chairs I don't see how the distress of a haircut will cause physical harm. Tue article you linked makes the point that the kids are disruptive to business in barber shops, which is much more compelling than the notion that clippers will harm kids.
Chaotross: When did I *ever* say the clippers would cut them? The answer is never. The kid would hurt himself trying to fight out of being restrained. Kids falling out of chairs is *exactly* the issue, along with possibly causing injury to themselves if they hit themselves with their reaction. Have some basic reading comprehension, please.
Shellphon3: It was perfectly clear that I was referring to children not being hurt by clippers and safety scissors,  please refer to my initial post.

And you know what's even more important? Supporting the creators who make the content you love. By using adblock, you're essentially saying that their hard work and dedication aren't worth paying for. Think about it, every time you watch a YouTube video, you're not just watching the video itself, you're also supporting the creator who made it. And if you're using adblock, you're essentially taking away from their ability to make a living.

And it's not just YouTube, it's Twitch streamers, podcasters, bloggers, and anyone else who creates content for the internet. By using adblock, you're not just blocking ads, you're blocking the creators' ability to make a living. And that's something that we should all think about before we decide to use adblock.

Now, I know what you're thinking, ""But ads are so annoying, I don't want to see them!"" And I get it, ads can be annoying. But the thing is, ads are what allow creators to make a living. Without ads, they wouldn't be able to produce the content that we love. And if you're using adblock, you're essentially taking away from their ability to produce that content.

So, the next time you're tempted to use adblock, think about the creators who make the content you love. Think about how your actions can affect them. And think about how you can support them in other ways. Because at the end of the day, it's not just about blocking ads, it's about supporting the people who make the content that we love.

And if you're still not convinced, think about all the other ways you can support creators. You can donate to their Patreon, buy their merchandise, or even just share their content with your friends and family. There are so many ways you can support creators, and it's up to you to decide how you want to do it.

So, the next time you're tempted to use adblock, remember that it's not just about blocking ads, it's about supporting the people who make the content that we love.

LOLatCucks: Did you read what I said? I feel like you expected some specific answer, didn't get it.... But still wanted to use the answer you already prepared here...

But I'll answer you anyway, even though your point is totally unrelated really...

If you already pay for something, you can do whatever you want with the content you receive. 

If I buy an iPhone, I'll remove and hack and do whatever I want.

If I did pay for cable, I'll do whatever I want with the content, because I've already paid for those ads. Whether I watch them or not does not matter anymore, they are paid for.

If I buy a candy bar (cable) I can do whatever I want with it after I buy it because I've bought and paid for it. It belongs to me.

Simple enough right?



Now the internet, instead I agree with mars bar that for each bite of a candy bar I take, they ask me 1 question (you can totally ignore it, but you have to let them ask it). Well you no longer bought and paid for the candy bar did you?

What would you call it in the second scenario if you just are the whole candy bar in one bite without following the basic mechanic that was setup in the first place?

The results of this analysis show that a combination of factors, including the lack of standardization in the interpretation process, the absence of clear guidelines for defect detection, and the limited training of inspectors, contributed to the failure to detect the defect.

Further investigation revealed that the inspectors involved in the case study had received inadequate training on the interpretation of radiographic images, which led to a lack of confidence in their ability to detect defects. Additionally, the inspectors had not been provided with clear guidelines on the criteria for defect detection, which resulted in a high degree of variability in the interpretation of the images. The study also found that the inspectors had not been adequately equipped with the necessary tools and resources to perform their tasks effectively, which further contributed to the failure to detect the defect.

The findings of this study highlight the importance of considering HOF in the evaluation of the performance of inspections. The results demonstrate that HOF can have a significant impact on the outcome of inspections, and that failure to consider these factors can lead to errors and omissions. The study's findings also emphasize the need for standardization in the interpretation process, clear guidelines for defect detection, and adequate training for inspectors. The results of this study have important implications for the development of more effective inspection procedures, and for the improvement of the overall performance of inspections."," the framework of the CREAM (Cognitive and Reliability and Error Analysis Method). A survey has been conducted during the training and the maintaining of the proficiency of NDT (Non Destructive Testing) operators. This was followed by a non-participant observation of operators on site and several individual interviews including a sample of people covering the main organizational and hierarchical roles (eg. project management, management, operations, invigilation). The exchange with the HOF experts resulted in a hierarchical analysis of ''radiogram interpretation'' tasks (31 sub-tasks) and a list of contextual and organizational factors that may affect the performance of interpretation of films by the operator. From such a description the CREAM method allows to determine critical tasks and probability of ``errors'' linked to a limited set of ``Common Performance Conditions'' (CPC). The first conclusions of this study are that the model CREAM seems well-adapted to the estimation of the impact of HOF on NDT performances. The next phases should be to apply it to other tasks (here only radiograph interpretation) and techniques. The expected benefit of this study is to provide tools for the evaluation and optimisation of NDT implementation."

Moreover, ITS can also help to optimize traffic signal control, traffic flow management, and public transportation systems, thereby improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of urban transportation.

For instance, multiagent systems can be used to simulate and analyze different scenarios, allowing transportation planners to evaluate the effectiveness of various strategies and make data-driven decisions. Additionally, multiagent systems can also be used to integrate different transportation modes, such as public transportation, ride-sharing, and pedestrian traffic, into a seamless and efficient system. This can be achieved by developing intelligent agents that can communicate with each other and adapt to changing traffic conditions, traffic patterns, and user preferences.

Furthermore, ITS can also be integrated with other urban systems, such as energy management, waste management, and emergency services, to create a smart city that is more efficient, sustainable, and livable. For example, intelligent traffic management systems can be used to optimize energy consumption by adjusting traffic signal timing and traffic flow management to reduce energy consumption. Similarly, intelligent waste management systems can be used to optimize waste collection routes and schedules to reduce traffic congestion and improve public health.

In conclusion, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel and manage urban transportation systems. By leveraging advances in artificial intelligence, multiagent systems, and smart transportation management infrastructures, ITS can help to reduce traffic congestion, improve traffic safety, and enhance the overall quality of life for urban residents."," be naturally modelled as autonomous agents that interact with the transportation management infrastructure, thereby generating a large-scale, open, agent-based system. To regulate such a system and maintain a smooth and efficient flow of traffic, decentralised mechanisms for the management of the transportation infrastructure are needed.

Building on the reservation-based intersection control model proposed by Dresner and Stone, we consider two different scenarios: one with a single intersection and one with a network of intersections. In the former, we analyse the performance of a novel policy based on combinatorial auctions for the allocation of reservations. In the latter, we analyse the impact that a traffic assignment strategy inspired by competitive markets has on the drivers route choices. Finally we propose an adaptive management mechanism that integrates the auction-based traffic control policy with the competitive traffic assignment strategy."

3) Use a gentle, chemical-free exfoliant once or twice a week to remove dead skin cells and unclog pores. This can be done using a natural ingredient like sugar or salt, or a product containing alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs). My wife has found that using a mixture of sugar and olive oil is a great way to exfoliate her skin without causing any irritation.

4) Apply a thin layer of aloe vera gel to your face after cleansing and steaming. Aloe vera has anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce redness and swelling, and it can also help to soothe and calm the skin. My wife has found that using aloe vera gel has made a big difference in the appearance of her skin, and it's also helped to reduce the occurrence of acne.

5) Finally, make sure to get enough sleep and maintain a healthy diet. Lack of sleep and a diet high in processed foods and sugar can cause inflammation and oxidative stress, which can contribute to acne. My wife has found that by getting at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night and eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, she's been able to keep her acne under control.

It's essential to consider the potential consequences of freezing your credit, as it can impact your ability to make financial decisions or take out loans in the future. For instance, if you're planning to buy a new car or a home, you'll need to temporarily lift the freeze to allow the lender to access your credit report. This might be inconvenient, especially if you're in a rush to finalize a deal.

However, if you're concerned about identity theft and don't mind the temporary inconvenience, freezing your credit can be a powerful tool to protect your financial information. Another option is to place a ""security freeze"" on your credit report, which allows you to lift the freeze temporarily for specific transactions or applications.

It's also important to note that freezing your credit won't prevent all types of identity theft. For example, a thief could still use your personal information to open a new bank account or apply for a loan. To further protect yourself, consider monitoring your credit reports regularly and setting up fraud alerts with the credit bureaus.

In addition to freezing your credit, there are other steps you can take to protect your identity. These include:

* Monitoring your credit reports regularly
* Setting up fraud alerts with the credit bureaus
* Being cautious when sharing personal information online or over the phone
* Using strong, unique passwords and keeping them confidential
* Keeping sensitive documents, such as Social Security cards and birth certificates, in a secure location

By taking these steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and protect your financial information. Remember, it's always better to be proactive and take control of your identity, rather than waiting for a problem to arise.

In conclusion, freezing your credit can be an effective way to protect your identity, but it's essential to understand the potential consequences and take additional steps to safeguard your financial information. By being informed and taking proactive measures, you can enjoy peace of mind knowing that your identity is secure."," on your cards or new card applications. Don’t get mad at the company for the decline. Freezing credit is usually done because of ID theft or concerns so if that freeze is on a report, it’s an automatic decline, no ifs ands or buts. Should you decide you want an increase or a new card or loan, you have to unfreeze everything *first* and *then* apply. Give it a cycle (a full day) to clear just to be safe so there’s not overlap between systems. I can’t tell you how often I’ve seen people livid about being declined for something despite their great credit score and then say yes when I ask if they’ve ever frozen their credit followed by no when I ask if they ever unfroze it.
tazmologist: I would argue that a byproduct of freezing your credit is that you have to be more thoughtful in it's use.  If you have to unfreeze before you apply for a credit card or an increase, you will take at least a moment to say ""Do I really need to do this""?  At least that has worked for me and improved my credit score by 200 points in the last 2 years in the process.
GoodAbbreviations164: I had my credit frozen for a few years.  It was great when you go to places like TJMaxx and they want you to apply for their card to save X% off today's purchase.  I just tell them my credit is frozen and they drop it.   It makes saying ""no"" much easier.  

But yes, when I was trying to get a car loan after my car had been totalled, it did add an extra layer of inconvenience trying to get that unfrozen for the day so they could inquire about my credit.    I am in the middle of a lot of change in my life, so when it's all back to boring every day is the same type of life, I will probably refreeze it.
Smartass_Narrator: Yeah it’s tough cuz the company can’t even tell you upfront that the reason you’re declined is because of a freeze. Logically, the consumer should know about the freeze and If it’s frozen it means the person applying *could* be the baddie and not the actual person (who should know about the freeze…. But maybe they forgot! So many variables!). The lender don’t know! It’s hard on everyone! So… decline. Better safe than sorry. Come back with unfrozen credit (and/or stop stealing peoples credit??)

Novels mostly did not exist in the format we read them in today, which is why they're written more dramatically and with cliff hangers. Jane Eyre for example was printed in 3 volumes. Some Dickens novels were cut up even smaller than that, the stories published in compendiums or other media.

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to recover from this initial burst of effort. I've been doing some light stretching, foam rolling, and taking regular breaks to avoid burnout, but I'm still feeling pretty sore. I've also been experimenting with different grip positions and lat width, but I'm not sure if that's the key to my fatigue. Should I focus on building up my endurance with assisted pull-ups or negatives, or is there a better way to approach this?

Another thing that's been bothering me is my form. I've been trying to focus on squeezing my lats and engaging my core, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly. Are there any specific exercises or drills that can help me improve my form and prevent injury?

Lastly, I'd love some guidance on how to incorporate other exercises into my routine to help balance out my strength. As I mentioned earlier, my lower body is pretty strong, but my upper body is really weak. Are there any exercises that can help me build up my strength and endurance in my shoulders, back, and arms without putting too much strain on my lower body?

Thanks in advance for any advice or guidance you can offer. I'm excited to start seeing some progress and getting back into shape!",". I'm wondering if people think it's better to just add more time in between workouts, to try and use my legs as assists (essentially pulling as hard as I can while slowly squatting), or something else. Obviously, losing weight would help with this and that's in process. But I'd like to work on pullups in the meantime.

* How married should I be to doing the whole routine 3x per week? I feel like it might help my motivation and progress to split up push and pull workouts, which might look like 
-day 1: pull-ups, rows, dumbbell shrugs, squats
-day 2: wall plank, parallel bar support, pushups, dips
-day 3: rest
-repeat


* I have heard from trustworthy people that core work can be an everyday thing. I'm thinking about doing bodyline more frequently, like 4-6 days/week. Thoughts?
Thenthereweretwo: 1. Can you do diamond pushups? The RR says not to start pull ups until you can do diamonds. You'll probably do them anyway, so one way you can do that is by getting a band and looping your foot through it, reducing the weight.

2. The FAQ says that beginners progress best with full body workouts 3x/week, but if you are more likely to stick with it if you do something else, I'd say do that. Just know that it may not be the 'best' way of doing it. To be honest, it sounds like you want to skip to a split routine because you think you'll progress faster, but its likely the opposite. 

3. I do body line every day. No problems there at all, and its awesome for my back.
JonWhiteFanged: Quick point...

The diamond push up requirement is for dips.
Horizontal rows is for pull ups.
PogueMahone82381: That's kind of a problem for me then. I don't have a good setup for rows. 

I can do incline rows by resting my feet on a stepstool and using my pullup bar. Those are pretty easy for me, so I imagine I'd be doing horizontals if I had the equipment. I'm guessing the disconnect here has to do with the relatively large amount of weight I carry in my legs as compared to my upper body.
FourOhTwo: Can you do a dead hang?
PogueMahone82381: I can, and now that I look into it, it seems that's what I ought to be doing - thanks for the tip!

What_the_what_show: That's a fascinating point. So, if we're saying that light doesn't behave like a particle, does that mean that the concept of a LightYear is flawed as well? And what about the speed of light being a constant? I've heard that Einstein's theory of relativity relies heavily on the idea that light travels at a consistent speed.

sunnyday420: Exactly! If we're not treating light as a particle, then the concept of a LightYear becomes meaningless. A LightYear is simply a unit of distance that's defined as the distance light travels in one year, but if light doesn't behave like a particle, then we can't use it as a basis for measuring distance. And as for the speed of light being a constant, that's another issue altogether. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, the speed of light is always constant, regardless of the observer's frame of reference. But if we're not treating light as a particle, then that constant speed becomes meaningless as well.

What_the_what_show: That's a lot to take in. So, what do you think is the correct way to understand light and its behavior? And how does that affect our understanding of the universe and the distances between stars and galaxies?

sunnyday420: Well, I think that light is a wave, a disturbance in the electromagnetic field that propagates through space. It's not a particle, and it's not a sound wave. It's a unique phenomenon that allows us to see and understand the universe around us. And if we treat it as a wave, rather than a particle, then we can start to re-evaluate our understanding of the universe and the distances between stars and galaxies.

What_the_what_show: That's a really interesting perspective. So, if we were to re-evaluate our understanding of light and its behavior, what would that mean for our understanding of the universe as a whole?

sunnyday420: It would mean that our understanding of the universe would be completely turned on its head. We would have to rethink our understanding of space and time, and how they relate to each other. We would have to re-evaluate our understanding of the distances between stars and galaxies, and how they are measured. And we would have to re-think our understanding of the speed of light and how it relates to the universe.

What_the_what_show: Wow, that's a lot to take in. So, what do you think is the next step in understanding light and its behavior? And how do you think scientists and researchers should approach this topic in the future?

sunnyday420: I think the next step is to start treating light as a wave, rather than a particle. We need to start thinking about light in terms of its electromagnetic properties, and how it interacts with the universe around us. We need to start using more accurate measurements and observations to understand the behavior of light, rather than relying on outdated theories and assumptions.

What_the_what_show: That's a great point. So, what do you think is the biggest misconception about light and its behavior that scientists and researchers need to overcome?

sunnyday420: I think the biggest misconception is that light is a particle. People have been treating light as a particle for so long that it's become second nature, but it's just not accurate. Light is a wave, and it's time for us to start treating it as such.

What_the_what_show: Well, I think that's a great place to wrap up our discussion. Thank you so much for sharing your insights and perspectives on light and its behavior. It's been really enlightening to talk to you!

sunnyday420: Thank you! It's been a pleasure to share my thoughts and ideas with you. I hope that our discussion has been helpful in shedding some light on the topic of light and its behavior."," tesla, he had an explanation as to why.. the background medium of ether that exists that enables the soundwave of light to propagate through. So that light is not an emission, its a perturbation in the ether!!

With this old way of how light functions which is closer to the truth, the speed of light as you know it is debunked
What_the_what_show: Well, that’s really interesting and I thank you for sharing it. If this is the case then why isn’t it the norm?
sunnyday420: Because what nikola tesla was teaching was too accurate and liberating in my opinion. Knowledge is power and to understand light would be too empowering. It could be weaponized and it liberate humanity and remove the wealth disparities. 

I appreciate you hearing me out because i get alot of bad reactions when i explain the ether. People think its outdated and debunked.

So the ether was called ""quintessence"" by the greek philosophers and ""prime material"" in alchemy. There are like hundreds of names for the ether in different cultures and everyone acknowledged it until 1915 with einsteins theory of relativity. 

In his theory of relativity it gives you medium of dark matter and spacetime. But really he is just renaming the ether and confusing people.

Do you have your ETHERnet chord plugged in? 😎👍
What_the_what_show: Often is the case where modern science can solve mysteries or update our views/knowledge. Do you not think it’s logical that this has been done with ether? Many ideas of the Greeks were also mythology. Do you have some reference material you would recommend?
sunnyday420: ""a picture can paint a thousand words"" so when ancient civilizations and greeks were using symbols and stories, you called it mythology. well turns out they were artfully describing the sky because the sky is really important. for example zues is jupiter.  the sumarians called it ""Dapinu"", or for the norse they called it thor.

&amp;#x200B;

So what you think are made up fantasy stories are actually describing the sky because the sky is really important. thats why they will spend so many resources faking space missions and stuff is to deceive you about what the sky really is. for only if you knew what the sky really was, it would empower you too much to be controlled.

I've been wondering if I'm just not doing it correctly, or if I need to focus on building up my strength in other areas before I can make progress on this step. I've tried doing more rows and lat pulldowns, but it doesn't seem to be making a difference. I've also been doing more core exercises like planks and side planks, but that hasn't seemed to help either.

I've been thinking about trying to mix it up a bit and doing some assisted pullups with a resistance band or a partner. Maybe that will help me build up some strength and confidence before I try to move on to the next step. Or maybe I just need to be patient and keep at it, and eventually I'll start to see some progress.

I've also been considering trying to incorporate some other exercises into my routine that target the same muscle groups as pullups. For example, I've been thinking about trying to do some ring dips or assisted ring dips. Maybe that will help me build up some strength and endurance in my arms and shoulders, which will in turn help me with my pullups.

I've been feeling a bit discouraged lately, but I'm trying to stay positive and focus on the progress I've made so far. I know it's not going to be easy, but I'm determined to get to the point where I can do a full pullup without any assistance. I just need to keep at it and stay consistent, and eventually I'll get there.

I've also been thinking about trying to incorporate some more variety into my workout routine. Maybe I'll try doing some different exercises that target the same muscle groups as pullups, or maybe I'll try doing some different types of workouts altogether. Maybe I'll try doing some yoga or Pilates, or maybe I'll try doing some strength training with weights. The possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to see what I can accomplish.

I just need to keep at it and stay consistent, and eventually I'll get there. I'm excited to see what the future holds, and I'm confident that with hard work and dedication, I'll be able to achieve my goal."," the bottom half no?

I don't know, I don't know how to proceed now but I really want to get on with pullups! I feel like I'd struggle to get a single deadhang pullup right now. Means I've gone backwards in a year. I know CC is meant to be helping with base strength and all at first but... does this make sense? I think if I wasn't doing grip training deadhangs I wouldn't even be able to hang off a bar. 

Would appreciate advice. Either put my head down and continue building reps with CC step  (I'm currently up to about 19 on the first set, 12 on the second. At my current rate I'd estimate I'll take another 4-5 months to reach progression standard) or move to a better more useful progression - if so what?
hybridchildren: Hey, don't be disheartened, man! I've spent over 1 year stuck on some exercise then suddenly progress super fast once I discovered the weakness in my training. I'm confident you can do it too.

So let me get this straight; you could do 3-4 full pull ups before doing CC? If so, why not start at level 5 instead of level 2? I'm guessing I'm misunderstanding you.

Anyway, like m092 says, my suggestion is to practice negatives to build up strength to reach full pull ups. I don't know how dedicated you are to CC, but I also suggest you abandon it (AT LEAST for pull ups; you can work on the other big 6 if you like) in favor of a different progression method. Depending on your goals, I think you can achieve full PU and OAPU following a simpler path. 

So here's what I'd do if I were you. 

#1 do (or build up to) 3x5 sets of FULL, slow negatives for your PU training. No more jack knife pulls. 

#2 I don't know the rest of your workout, but if this is an important goal, put the negatives in the beginning of the workout. 

#3 Once you are more confident with your negatives, give PUs a shot again. If you can do 1 set of 3 reps, I'd say thats enough to move on from negatives and start training PUs themselves. Work up to 3x5 again.

#4 If you have spare weight in the form of fat, focus on losing some of it through healthier/reduced eating. This will not only help your PUs but all other BW exercises. DO NOT amputate a leg or two for quick gainz.

#5 report back in 2 weeks with progress, no matter how small or big.

I completely agree with your assessment. The first half of Of Grammatology can be quite challenging, but it's essential to grasp the concepts Derrida presents. It's like trying to understand a puzzle with many pieces that don't quite fit together yet. However, as you continue reading, you start to see the connections between the different ideas and how they relate to each other. The second half of the book becomes more accessible, and you begin to appreciate the complexity of Derrida's thought.

One of the key takeaways from Of Grammatology is the concept of différance, which is often misunderstood as simply being about the delay or deferral of meaning. While that's part of it, différance is actually a more nuanced and multifaceted concept that challenges traditional notions of language, meaning, and time. It's a bit like trying to grasp a slippery fish – the more you think you have it, the more it slips away.

Another important aspect of the book is Derrida's critique of logocentrism and phonocentrism. He argues that Western philosophy has been dominated by a logocentric approach, which prioritizes speech and writing over other forms of communication. This has led to a neglect of non-verbal forms of expression, such as gestures, images, and music. Derrida's work is an attempt to challenge this dominance and open up new possibilities for thinking about language and communication.

Despite the challenges, I think Of Grammatology is a crucial work that rewards close reading and attention. It's not an easy book, but it's a rich and complex one that offers many insights into the nature of language, meaning, and culture. If you're willing to put in the effort, you'll be rewarded with a deeper understanding of Derrida's thought and its implications for philosophy, literature, and culture.

In fact, I think Of Grammatology is one of those rare books that gets better with each reading. The more you know about Derrida's ideas, the more you'll appreciate the complexity and depth of his arguments. It's a bit like trying to solve a puzzle – the more you learn, the more you realize how cleverly the pieces fit together.

So, to answer your question, I think it's definitely worth pushing through to the end of the book. It may be challenging, but it's a challenge that will reward you with a deeper understanding of Derrida's thought and its significance for our understanding of language, culture, and the human condition.",".  Along those lines, the second half where he really digs in to Rousseau is I suppose more the ""exercise in"" portion, where Derrida is taking the quasi-axiomatic he has set out to pick apart the blind spots in Rousseau.  As addressing the blind spots, the neglected theoretical gaps in the text, is the central work of deconstruction, you have to apply the same ethic that Derrida applies to Rousseau to your own reading of Derrida, and in doing so you should (Derrida might hope) be able to discern the method that's at work.

Basically, the work is in a lot of ways an exposition of Derrida's method, so what you should be reading for is not a concrete set of points in which he agrees or disagrees with Rousseau, but a set of tools that he uses and which you might be able to use in your own readings.  So look in the blind spots, look at what Derrida is doing, more than the results that may or may not be coherently spit out at the end.

One last semi-tip: Paul de Man's essay in ""Blindness and Insight"" on Derrida's reading of Rousseau is an illuminating work of deconstruction in its own right, and for me it made the process of reading Derrida make a lot more sense (i.e. I knew what the hell I was doing when I was reading Derrida, which as I've implied here is more important than knowing what he is ""actually saying"")

Also, understanding Derrida to some degree is absolutely essential to grappling with most things that could rightly be called post-[put anything here].  That, and it's one of the most intellectually challenging and rewarding things I've ever read.  It made me feel like I needed to go back and re-read everything I've ever read with a new critical energy.  Some call it wordy and dry, but for me it was a lot of fun!  I realize I didn't actually explain any of his points here at all, except that deconstruction is a METHOD...so if you wanna chat more directly about da facts, we can do that!
ravia: Method or strategy?
[deleted]: good point, I kinda like using ""strategy"" here...gives it the 'political' edge that Derrida's later writings insisted were there all along.
ravia: Perhaps that says something about his, erm, difficulties with Gadamer, who wrote *Truth and Method*.

The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to accurately identify the apparent elastic properties of the random heterogeneous material, even in the presence of noise and uncertainty in the input data. This work has significant implications for the development of new materials and technologies, as it provides a powerful tool for predicting the behavior of complex materials under various conditions.

Furthermore, the proposed method can be extended to other types of random heterogeneous materials, such as composites and metamaterials, by adapting the computational model and the neural network architecture. Additionally, the method can be used to identify the apparent elastic properties of materials with complex microstructures, such as those found in biological tissues or porous media. The ability to accurately predict the behavior of these materials is crucial for a wide range of applications, including biomedical engineering, materials science, and environmental engineering.

In future work, it would be beneficial to investigate the impact of different neural network architectures and training algorithms on the performance of the proposed method. Additionally, the method could be extended to identify other properties of the random heterogeneous material, such as its thermal or electrical conductivity. The proposed method has the potential to revolutionize the field of materials science by providing a powerful tool for predicting the behavior of complex materials under various conditions."," artificial neural networks are then trained from each of the initial and processed databases to construct an algebraic representation of the nonlinear mapping between the hyperparameters (network outputs) and the quantities of interest (network inputs). The performances of the trained artificial neural networks are analyzed in terms of mean squared error, linear regression fit and probability distribution between network outputs and targets for both databases. An ad hoc probabilistic model of the input random vector is finally proposed in order to take into account uncertainties on the network input and to perform a robustness analysis of the network output with respect to the input uncertainties level. The capability of the proposed neural network-based identification method to efficiently solve the underlying statistical inverse problem is illustrated through two numerical examples developed within the framework of 2D plane stress linear elasticity, namely a first validation example on synthetic data obtained through computational simulations and a second application example on real experimental data obtained through a physical experiment monitored by digital image correlation on a real heterogeneous biological material (beef cortical bone)."

After researching various 3D design tools, I came across Fusion 360, SketchUp, and Autodesk Inventor. Fusion 360 seems to be a popular choice among woodworkers, with a free version available for hobbyists and startups. SketchUp is known for its ease of use and intuitive interface, making it a great choice for those who aren't familiar with 3D modeling. Autodesk Inventor is a more advanced tool, but it's also more expensive.

I decided to start with Fusion 360, as it seems to have the most features that would be useful for my projects. I downloaded the free version and started playing around with it. The interface is user-friendly, and I was able to create a simple 3D model of my loft bed design within a few hours.

One of the features I liked most about Fusion 360 is the ability to create a detailed bill of materials (BOM) and a cut list. This will make it easy for me to order the exact lumber I need, and ensure that I have all the necessary materials before starting the build.

I also experimented with the rendering feature, which allows you to create photorealistic images of your design. This will be helpful for visualizing the final product and making any necessary adjustments before starting the build.

In addition to Fusion 360, I also considered using a 2D CAD software like AutoCAD or SolidWorks. However, since I'm not familiar with 2D CAD, I decided to focus on a 3D design tool that would allow me to create a more immersive and interactive design experience.

As I continue to work on my designs, I'm excited to see how they turn out and how they will help me bring my projects to life. With the help of Fusion 360 and my dad's expertise, I'm confident that I'll be able to create a beautiful and functional loft bed and couch that will be the envy of all my friends.

I'm also considering using Fusion 360's collaboration features to work with my dad on the design. This will allow us to work together in real-time, making it easier to communicate and make changes to the design. I'm looking forward to seeing how this will help us create a more accurate and efficient design.

Overall, I'm excited to be using Fusion 360 for my wood projects, and I'm confident that it will help me create designs that are both beautiful and functional. With its ease of use, advanced features, and collaboration capabilities, Fusion 360 is an excellent choice for anyone looking to create custom wood designs.

As I continue to work on my designs, I'll be sure to share my progress and any challenges I encounter. I'm excited to see how my projects turn out and how Fusion 360 will help me bring my ideas to life.",".

What would be absolutely amazing is some kind of software or website that has all different types of virtual build materials (lumber, nails, screws, etc) that would allow me to virtually build my items. If such a thing does not already exist, it definitely should. I'd pay good money for it.

Can anyone point me in the right direction?
PenPlotter: as someone who drafts for a living, i can only say this so many times,

* If you cant draw it out with a pencil, ruler and a big sheet of paper then inventor, proe/creo, solidworks autocad, google sketchup, 3dsmax, autodesk 123d, is not going to be any help at all.
* ------------------
* On to tips to help you along with your project,
* ---
* Drawing tips, stick with strait edges if you want curves deal with that later this is to get the basic design down, go buy a 1M ruler a square, and some a3 paper. in the time it would take you to learn how to use the 3d software you would be finished drawing it
* Use bolts washers and nylok nuts where possible rather than screws, the rule of thumb for selecting your bolt length is
* Thk material your bolting together + thickness of washer x 2 (est 3mm) + nut + half of nut again
* Id say use m12 [coach bolt](http://cdn.toolstation.com/images/130125-UK/images/library/stock/webbig/75743.jpg), that way you get a nice dome on your display side  

if you absolutely cant draw or get stuck pop me a message and ill draw something up for you :)
calion009: Thanks! I'm working on it with Google Sketchup. The thing is, it looks good in my head and seems like the design should be sturdy, but without me actually physically building the thing I have no idea. I've never really built anything this big before.

I'm using 4 4x4 6 foot corner posts, and thinking about connecting them with 2x4s. The question is how to go about doing that in the sturdiest way.
rgraham888: I would use 2x6s around the edge and to connect your 4x4s together.  Depending on the length, you might want to add additional 4x4 legs if you have a particularly long span.  Connect the 2x6s to the 4x4s with at least 2 carriage bolts on each join.  Also, it sounds like you want this to be free standing, so you'll want some cross bracing on the sides and back between the legs.
calion009: It needs to be about 7 feet long and 5 feet wide. Think I'd need more than 4 4x4 posts? 
rgraham888: probably.  I'd at least do another post along the back section  in the middle of the 7"" span.  THat is, assuming you want to have the front section open for coutches, etc.

sad,id1840,human," I'm in a situation where I feel like I'm being judged or evaluated, like when I'm in a classroom or when I'm being assessed. It's like my brain just shuts down and I become this introverted, silent person who doesn't know what to say.

I've also noticed that I tend to compare myself to others in school, and it's like I'm constantly trying to measure up to their standards. I feel like I'm not good enough, that I'm not smart enough, that I'm not interesting enough. It's like I'm constantly trying to prove myself, but it's a losing battle because no matter how hard I try, I always feel like I'm falling short.

At work, it's different. I don't feel like I'm being judged or evaluated as much, and I don't feel like I'm in competition with anyone. I can just be myself, and people seem to like me for who I am. I'm not trying to prove anything, I'm just being friendly and helpful and doing my job to the best of my ability.

I wish I could be more like that in school. I wish I could be more confident and outgoing, and not let my fear of being judged hold me back. But it's hard, because it's a habit that's been ingrained in me for so long.

I've been trying to work on it, though. I've been practicing my public speaking skills, and I've been trying to be more assertive and speak up in class. It's hard, but I'm getting better. And I've been trying to focus on my strengths and what I'm good at, rather than comparing myself to others.

It's a journey, and it's not easy. But I'm determined to overcome my fears and be the best version of myself, both in school and in life."," I feel like there's someone above me, someone who knows more, etc. just someone that is on a higher level than I am. At school (at this point I should probably say I'm in university) I view my peers as being at a higher place than I am, for some reason, so I just stop. Functioning.

I went a year and a half with no friends. Not even acquaintances. That's how bad it is.

While at work everybody's the same, and I get to be friendly with everyone. My coworkers, other shop workers, janitors, and even customers.

I started working at the same time I started uni, so this difference is very prominent.

I try to reprogram myself into thinking that everyone is the same in class... but it just never works.

What should I do? Any advice on how to put my work personality into school?
derrickhoardlmft: ""I've analysed myself at work and tried to implement what I do there at school, like smiling from ear to ear, say hi first, laughs, but it just doesn't work.""

givememyfunback: The conversation I try to make or keep going by doing them never seem to continue. At work I can just laugh and reply with ""oh really?"" They'd go ""yeah!"" And continue whatever they were saying, while when I do that in school they'd polite giggle and stop... I don't understand. Maybe I did it wrong?
derrickhoardlmft: Was it always like that at work?
givememyfunback: Yes, it did take awhile though. I wasn't as open as I am now when I started (fresh off high school nerves). The girls at work just kind of 'adopted' me even though I was difficult to pierce through.
derrickhoardlmft: Imagine the people that you want to connect with in class, were like you were when you first started work ""difficult to pierce through"".  What would you have needed someone to do in order to get through to you?  You will find that this is something that now YOU have to do at school.  There is just a different dynamic in school than at work.  At work, you are all working towards a shared goal ""get done with the day and get paid"".  At school, everyone has different goals and motivations.  It is harder to connect.
givememyfunback: That's true.. I'll have to see what kind of dynamic is present in my classes.. hope I can adjust my methods accordingly. Thank you

sad,id398,human,": I completely agree with texaseclectus. Credit unions are often a better option for young adults like yourself, as they tend to have more personalized service and lower fees. When opening your account, be sure to ask about any fees associated with services such as ATM withdrawals, online bill pay, and mobile banking. You should also inquire about the credit union's mobile app and online banking platform to ensure it meets your needs.

In addition to asking about fees, it's also important to understand the interest rates offered by the credit union. As a college student, you may be looking for a high-yield savings account or a certificate of deposit (CD) with a competitive interest rate. Be sure to ask about the credit union's interest rates and any minimum balance requirements to avoid fees.

Another important question to ask is about the credit union's mobile deposit feature. This allows you to deposit checks remotely using your smartphone, which can be a convenient option for students who may not have a lot of time to visit a physical branch. You should also ask about the credit union's ATM network and whether they have any partnerships with other banks or credit unions that offer surcharge-free ATM access.

When it comes to credit cards and debit cards, you should ask about the benefits and rewards programs offered by the credit union. Some credit unions offer cashback rewards, travel insurance, or other perks that can be valuable to students. You should also inquire about the credit limit and interest rate on the credit card, as well as any fees associated with late payments or foreign transactions.

As a college student, you may also be interested in investing your money in a retirement account or a brokerage account. Be sure to ask the credit union about their investment options and any fees associated with these services. You should also inquire about any financial education resources or workshops offered by the credit union to help you make informed decisions about your finances.

In conclusion, opening your first bank account can seem overwhelming, but by asking the right questions, you can find a credit union that meets your needs and helps you achieve your financial goals. Remember to ask about fees, interest rates, mobile deposit, ATM access, credit cards, debit cards, and investment options. With the right credit union, you can start building a strong financial foundation for your future.",": Why?
texaseclectus: Everyone at some point, for a variety of reasons, will not have enough money in there account to cover something they're paying for. 
It's going to happen. A LOT. It's not a big deal.

So here's what happens when you run out of money and try to pay for something with no ""protection""-

The sale or transfer is declined and you are immediately notified. There are no penalties and you have an opportunity to investigate/transfer money/ or just decline the sale. Nothing happens and you dont lose anything you dont owe anything.
Essentially you are promptly made aware of your financial status and are able - FREE OF CHARGES - to make decisions regarding that status.
This prevents you from spending what you dont have and costs nothing. Its essential. 

With overdraft ""protection""
You are NOT notified that there isn't enough money to cover something. The bank instead agrees to the sale on your behalf, gives you a loan to cover it and charges you 30 bucks for the service. You're giving them permission to fine you 30 bucks for not having money to cover something, WHY? 

Not having enough money sucks but for the love of God do not ask a bank to take 30 bucks from you every time it happens.

Edit adding example for context:
Imagine you wake up payday, and it's a federal holiday you weren't aware of. You haven't been paid but you *think* you have so you go about your day. 
If you have overdraft protection every purchase you make that day will have a 30$ fee tied to it. Get gas, buy coffee, buy lunch and BOOM you owe 90 bucks because you didnt know it was veterans day.
Without protection you'll be notified you dont have $ instantly and learn your bank doesn't process checks on veterans day so nothing happens.
JJ_burrito: My bank just charges interest on the overdraft balance, can’t believe yours charges $30 per transaction.
Maybe look for another bank?
texaseclectus: I can't believe youre ok with paying interest for no reason. 

I could literally just tell your bank ""no overdraft protection"" and I'm being charged less than you. Maybe tell your bank ""no overdraft protection""?
JJ_burrito: I’m paying interest on a loan. It comes out to cents per day which is much preferred to $30 per transaction.

Sometimes I need the overdraft
texaseclectus: ""Cents per day"" amounts to the same thing as that 30 bucks when you compare the alternative of 0.
Both sums are this equation:

 I'm not paying any money and you're paying *some* money.

Micro loans are never necessary and you never need overdraft.
JJ_burrito: Not true. Altogether I’ve never paid $30 in overdraft interest.

Just switch banks bro stop being dumb
texaseclectus: Drop your overdraft protection dude. I promise it doesn't hurt. I'm at your bank they said it's cool, you dont have to be scared anymore.

this dude is so triggered by my common sense he's reported me to reddit care resources! My very first, I'm touched.

The gas station in Finland, on the other hand, had a bit of a different situation. The customer, who wished to remain anonymous, had been filling up his tank at the same station for years and was familiar with the pumps. When he noticed the incredibly low price, he couldn't believe his eyes and decided to fill up his 1000-liter canister to see if it was a genuine mistake.

After filling up the tank, he went inside to pay and was met with a mixture of confusion and amusement from the cashier. The station manager was called over, and after verifying the price on the pump, they agreed that it was indeed a mistake and that the customer had every right to take advantage of it.

The customer, who was over the moon with his incredible bargain, decided to donate some of the gas to local charities and keep the rest for himself. He also offered to return to the station and fill up again if the price was still low, which the station manager gratefully accepted.

The incident sparked a lot of debate in the community about whether it's right for customers to take advantage of obvious mistakes like this. Some people felt that the customer was entitled to the low price, while others believed that he should have reported the mistake to the authorities and let them handle it.

The gas station, on the other hand, was grateful for the customer's honesty and generosity. They took steps to ensure that the price was corrected and that similar mistakes wouldn't happen in the future.

In the end, the customer got to keep his incredible bargain, and the gas station was able to maintain its reputation for being a fair and honest business. The incident also served as a reminder to always double-check prices before filling up, especially when they seem too good to be true.

As for the customer, he was thrilled with his windfall and made sure to fill up his tank regularly to make the most of his good fortune. He even started a blog to document his adventures and share his experiences with others, becoming something of a local celebrity in the process.

RearEchelon: I got a $199.99 paintball gun for $19.99 from K-mart a long time ago.
Pats2k1: No you didn’t. You stole a $199 paintball gun for $19.99.
XavierYourSavior: Wrong
Pats2k1: I would bet that more than 1/2 of the people defending this have shoplifted or committed some sort of petty theft more than once. This is the same mentality as the person who steals your credit card and blows $100 on stupid shit at a gas station. It doesn’t matter what they steal, it’s the mindset of getting something for nothing.
XavierYourSavior: 1. I never stole
2. Stealing someone’s credit card is.. theft? Not sure how that’s relevant.
3. In Russia for example, whatever the price tag is that’s what they have to legally sell it for. It’s not theft, it’s ignorance on the stores part. If I sold my PC for 100 USD and it’s an alien ware high end pc, and later realized it’s worth 2000 and regret it, it’s still not theft on the buyers part. Even if they knew it’s under valued, it was sold for that amount and isn’t theft.
Pats2k1: We are not talking about pricing an item poorly we are talking about a typo made by a clerk. This isn’t ignorance it’s a mistake. Have you ever gotten back too much change? I assume you would have kept that too.
XavierYourSavior: I honestly wouldn’t count my change because it’s something I usually trust they get right and never occurred to me to count it unless it’s a big mistake, one time someone at a gas station gave me a twenty dollar bill. I kept telling him it was a mistake and it took a few tries because he was confused and didn’t speak English lol. Regardless, it’s still not theft. If you have an item and accidentally wrote 5 dollars instead of 10, that’s their fault and it’s not theft.
Pats2k1: Your logic still doesn’t make it right. Let’s not use little $5.00 mistakes that an honest person might miss just to try and make a point. This guy is stealing thousands of dollars and people in here are boasting about how they got away with stealing hundreds and thousands of dollars from ATMs etc.

The benefits of method extraction are numerous, allowing developers to write more concise and flexible code. For instance, in Python, the `functools.partial` function can be used to extract methods from objects, enabling the creation of partial functions that can be used as standalone functions. Similarly, in PHP, the `Closure` class can be used to extract methods from objects, allowing developers to create anonymous functions that can be used as standalone functions. In Flow and TypeScript, the `Function` type can be used to extract methods from objects, enabling the creation of functions that can be used as standalone functions.

However, method extraction also presents several challenges for type systems. One of the main challenges is ensuring that the extracted methods are correctly typed. In particular, the type of the extracted method must be determined based on the type of the object from which it was extracted. This can be a complex task, especially in languages that support polymorphism and inheritance.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel solution that uses a combination of type inference and type specialization to ensure that the extracted methods are correctly typed. Our solution is based on the idea of using a type specialization mechanism to specialize the type of the extracted method based on the type of the object from which it was extracted. This allows us to ensure that the extracted method is correctly typed, even in the presence of polymorphism and inheritance.

We have implemented our solution in a prototype system and evaluated its effectiveness using a set of benchmark programs. Our results show that our solution is able to correctly type the extracted methods in a wide range of scenarios, including scenarios that involve polymorphism and inheritance. We believe that our solution has the potential to significantly improve the flexibility and expressiveness of object-oriented programming languages, and we plan to continue developing and refining our solution in the future.",". In many of these languages, the programmer can then explicitly specify the `this` value to be used when the method implementation is called. Unfortunately, as we show, existing gradual type systems such as TypeScript and Flow are unsound in the presence of method extraction. The problem for typing any such system is that the flexibility it allows must be tamed by requiring a connection between the object the method was extracted from, and the function value that is later called. In Racket, where a method extraction-like facility, dubbed ""structure type properties"", is fundamental to classes, generic methods, and other APIs, these same challenges arise, and must be solved to support this feature in Typed Racket. We show how to combine two existing type system features -- existential types and occurrence typing -- to produce a sound approach to typing method extraction. We formalize our design, extending an existing formal model of the Typed Racket type system, and prove that our extension is sound. Our design is also implemented in the released version of Racket, and is compatible with all existing Typed Racket packages, many of which already used a previous version of this feature."

Today, the Kingdom of Crystal is still a thriving industry, with many of the original glassworks still in operation. Visitors can tour the glassworks and watch skilled artisans at work, creating beautiful and intricate pieces of glass. The Kingdom of Crystal is also home to several museums and exhibitions, showcasing the history and craftsmanship of the glass industry. In addition, the area is known for its picturesque countryside, with rolling hills and forests providing a beautiful backdrop for outdoor activities such as hiking and cycling.

One of the most famous glassworks in the Kingdom of Crystal is Orrefors, which has been producing high-quality glass for over 100 years. Orrefors is known for its stunning crystal chandeliers, which are highly sought after by interior designers and collectors. Another well-known glassworks is Kosta, which has been producing glass since 1742. Kosta is known for its beautiful glass vases and decorative items, which are highly prized by collectors.

In recent years, the Kingdom of Crystal has seen a resurgence in popularity, with many young designers and artists becoming interested in the traditional craft of glassblowing. This has led to the development of new and innovative designs, which blend traditional techniques with modern materials and styles. The Kingdom of Crystal is also home to several schools and workshops, where students can learn the art of glassblowing and develop their skills.

Overall, the Kingdom of Crystal is a unique and fascinating area, with a rich history and culture that is still thriving today. Whether you are interested in art, history, or simply beautiful glass, the Kingdom of Crystal is a must-visit destination."," factories were established with more than half of them situated in Småland.
When touring the forested province of Småland in Sweden, it is normal to visit at least one of the glassworks. The larger ones have adjacent museums and are open for visitors to see the glass blowing hall, normally looking down from a platform. Food is available as well as shopping for various glass products such as glasses, bowls, vases and unique glass ornaments. The Kingdom of Crystal is a popular and a well known tourist destination. The Regional Council of Kalmar County conducts a study every four years to survey the Swedish public regarding their knowledge and awareness about Kalmar County, its places to visit and tourist attractions. The survey was conducted by Kantar Sifo and included 1500 respondents aged 20–79 years old. The survey results found that the Kingdom of Crystal area was the most visited tourist attraction in the Kalmar County attracting a wide range of people. One in five aged 40–79 years old had visited the area in the last five years. The visitors had no significant difference in terms of geographical belonging, income or gender. The only difference that could be noted was that the group visiting the area tended to be of older age rather than young. Among the respondents aged 40–65+ years old only 3% claimed they never heard of the Kingdom of Crystal.
The more notable are Orrefors Glasbruk, with the adjacent National School of Glass and Kosta Glasbruk, which is the basis for the Kosta Boda company. Each one of the glassworks have distinctive design traditions, character and atmosphere.

The song's success can be attributed to its unique blend of traditional Christian hymnody and modern pop music. The use of ""Auld Lang Syne"" as the melody added a sense of familiarity and nostalgia to the song, while the lyrics of the Lord's Prayer provided a sense of timelessness and universality. The song's message of hope and redemption resonated with listeners around the world, and it quickly became a beloved classic.

In the years since its release, ""The Millennium Prayer"" has been covered by numerous artists and has become a staple of Christian music. It has also been used in a variety of contexts, including church services, weddings, and funerals. The song's enduring popularity is a testament to its timeless message and its ability to bring people together in a shared experience of worship and celebration.

Despite its success, ""The Millennium Prayer"" was not without its controversy. Some critics accused the song of being overly sentimental and manipulative, while others saw it as a powerful expression of faith and devotion. Regardless of one's opinion on the song, it remains a significant and enduring part of Christian music and a testament to the power of music to bring people together and inspire us to greater heights.",", featured on the musical's soundtrack album Hopes & Dreams: A New Musical For A New Millennium released in January 1999. Paul Field had also told Richard of his wife's suggestion, ""that it would make a great Christmas single for Cliff."" Richard took up the suggestion and recorded a new version for release as a single in the lead up to Christmas, with Field hearing of the recording from Richard after it had been recorded.
Richard's record label, EMI, declined to release it amid concerns about its commercial potential, so Richard approached the independent record label Papillon Records for the release, with the proceeds going to the charity Children's Promise.
Richard performed the song exclusively on the TV programme An Audience with... Cliff Richard before a music video had been made for it. Richard asked, during breaks, for a room with a camera and green screen; he would then record all of the footage of him to be used in the video for ""The Millennium Prayer"" in less than an hour.
The song was beaten to the British Christmas number-one single for 1999 by Westlife, having been number one for the three preceding weeks. It was also Richard's 14th UK No. 1 hit, his 112th hit overall, the third highest-selling single of his career. The song reached No. 2 in a poll of all-time worst singles in 2003 run by Channel 4. The song won the Ivor Novello Award for the best selling single of 1999. Richard released the single with a neutral view, stating it was a way in which people could unite, regardless of their belief system or religion they adhere to.
The version Richard released as a single was not taken from any album, however the following year the song was included on Richard's compilation album The Whole Story: His Greatest Hits and in 2003 on his album Cliff at Christmas."

The SWE probe was positioned on the abdominal aorta, and the shear wave speed was measured at different blood pressure levels. The results showed a significant correlation between the shear wave speed and invasive arterial pressure, indicating that SWE can accurately assess arterial stiffness in vivo. Additionally, the shear wave speed was found to be sensitive to changes in arterial diameter, suggesting that SWE can provide valuable information on the mechanical properties of arteries. These findings have important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and highlight the potential of SWE as a non-invasive tool for assessing arterial stiffness in various animal models and potentially in humans.",". The SWE acquisition followed by an ultrafast (UF) acquisition was repeated at different moment of the cardiac cycle to assess shear wave speed and arterial diameter variations respectively. Invasive arterial BP catheter placed in the carotid, allowed the accurate measurement of pressure responses to increasing does of phenylephrine infused via a venous catheter. The SWE acquisition coupled to the UF acquisition was repeated for different range of pressure. For normal range of BP, the shear wave speed was found to follow the aortic BP variation during a cardiac cycle. A minimum of (5.06$\pm$0.82) m/s during diastole and a maximum of (5.97$\pm$0.90) m/s during systole was measured. After injection of phenylephrine, a strong increase of shear wave speed (13.85$\pm$5.51) m/s was observed for a peak systolic arterial pressure of (190$\pm$10) mmHg. A non-linear relationship between shear wave speed and arterial BP was found. A complete non-invasive method was proposed to characterize the artery with shear wave speed combined with arterial diameter variations. Finally, the results were validated against two parameters the incremental elastic modulus and the pressure elastic modulus derived from BP and arterial diameter variations."

Xanjis: But what about the benefits? Genetically engineered crops can resist pests and diseases, reducing the need for pesticides and herbicides. They can also be designed to thrive in challenging environments, increasing food security.
Moon-Arms: Yes, I agree that there are benefits, but we need to weigh those benefits against the potential risks. We're not just talking about the food itself, but also the impact on the ecosystem and the potential for unintended consequences.
Xanjis: But what about the scientific consensus? The overwhelming majority of scientists agree that genetically modified organisms are safe for human consumption and the environment.
Moon-Arms: That may be true, but science is not always black and white. There are many unknowns and uncertainties, and we need to be cautious and responsible in our approach to genetic engineering.
Xanjis: I understand your concerns, but I think we're missing the bigger picture. The real issue is not whether genetically modified organisms are safe or not, but whether they're necessary. Are we really running out of food? Is there really a crisis that we need to address with genetic engineering?
Moon-Arms: Well, according to the United Nations, the world's population is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, and we'll need to produce 70% more food to feed everyone. Climate change is also affecting agricultural productivity and food security. Genetic engineering could be a tool to help us meet these challenges.
Xanjis: I see your point, but I still think we're putting the cart before the horse. We need to focus on sustainable agriculture practices, reduce waste, and promote food sovereignty. Genetic engineering is just a Band-Aid solution that won't address the root causes of the problem.

We also need to invest in research and development of new technologies, including genetic engineering. And we need to have a open and transparent dialogue about the potential benefits and risks of these technologies.

Additionally every generation of selective breeding can change hundreds of genes so by your logic selectively bred crops (every crop that isn't GMO) should be massively more toxic then GMO plants.


In fact in selective breeding we even irradiate our own plants in order to generate interesting new mutants.

sad,id1747,human,", it's not just about having access to healthy food options, but also about the time and effort required to prepare those meals. With the rise of fast food and convenience stores, it's become easier than ever to grab a quick and easy meal that's high in calories and low in nutrients. And let's be real, who doesn't love the taste of a freshly baked pizza or the convenience of a microwaveable meal?

But the problem goes deeper than just individual choices. The way our society is structured, with long work hours and limited vacation time, doesn't exactly encourage healthy habits. We're constantly on the go, with no time to stop and smell the roses, let alone cook a healthy meal. And with the rise of social media, we're constantly bombarded with images of perfect, airbrushed bodies, making it even harder to feel good about ourselves and our eating habits.

And then there's the issue of poverty. For many people, especially those living in rural areas or with limited access to transportation, healthy food options may not be readily available. A study by the USDA found that in 2019, nearly 1 in 5 households in the United States struggled to afford food, and that number is likely even higher today.

So, what's the solution? It's not just about individual responsibility, but also about systemic change. We need to create a society that values health and wellness, where people have the time and resources to make healthy choices. We need to make healthy food options more accessible and affordable, and we need to address the root causes of poverty and inequality.

In the meantime, we can all make small changes in our own lives. We can start by cooking at home more often, and by making healthier choices when we do eat out. We can also support local farmers and food banks, and advocate for policies that promote healthy eating and living. And most importantly, we can work to create a society that values health and wellness for all, not just the privileged few.

By working together, we can create a healthier, more sustainable future for ourselves and for generations to come."," even if healthy can be just as cheap as unhealthy, unhealthy wins because it has less time investment.
GreyDeath: &gt; Everything you listed takes effort to turn into a healthy meal. People do not make home cooked meals as often anymore. Modern society ""doesn't have time"" - really doesn't make time - for that.

I managed to get through med school and an Internal Medicine residency and had enough time to eat healthy. You can grill a chicken breast with lemon pepper seasoning in 10 minutes, while you microwave the veggies with a small amount of water to steam them. After that is done you can toss a decent salad in 15 minutes. That's a quality meal in less than half an hour. You have to make time. Plus, the items I listed can be cooked in larger batches on the weekend to make multiple, ready to eat meals. Ultimately, even if you have to rely on less healthy, processed foods, having good portion control will prevent morbid obesity. 
Zorbick: I get what you're saying, but that is still more effort than a microwave dinner. And you will have more dishes afterward to clean. It's not impossible to eat healthy while being busy, it's just not the easiest so it doesn't happen as often.
GreyDeath: People managed to do so in the past, when microwaves were not an option. And like I said, beyond that, even if cooking your own meals were not an option, limiting caloric intake to not be greater than your total daily expenditure is always an option. 
palebluedott: It's just not that simple, if it were the obesity epidemic would be falling not rising.
GreyDeath: I know it's not simple, which is why I think boiling it down to just price is not accurate either. [Compared to other developed countries](http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2012/01/america-food-spending-less) the average US household spends less on food as a percentage of their budget, while at the same time we have a higher average income. Additionally, we now spend less compared to how much we spent 30 years ago. Food costs are at a near all time low, so I don't feel like healthy food being too expensive is the primary reason for the epidemic. Perhaps just the fact that unhealthy food is cheaper relative to healthy food is part of it, but then that boils to poor choices, meaning we should focus on education. 

You pair that with a drastic decrease in physical activity due to multiple reasons (decrease in labor intensive jobs, increase in sedentary leisure activities like watching TV) and people are going to gain weight. But this is a complex behavioral problem that can't be boiled down to ""well people are too busy"" because its not true in other countries, nor was it true in our past. 
palebluedott: Well unfortunately here on reddit,  if you don't say exactly what you mean right out of the gate you're always inevitably bound to be drawn out so you can say it in depth.  Now I agree with you. It's a combo of medical, psychological, processed, convenience, and culture to be brief, but for some reason many folks never seem to acknowledge all of this,  it always comes down to ""just"" arguments, you know?

sad,id1553,human,".

It's a valid question to ask whether the pursuit of knowledge through science, mathematics, and historical research can be considered part of philosophy. In the past, the boundaries between disciplines were not as clearly defined, and philosophy was seen as the overarching framework for understanding the world. The ancient Greeks, for example, saw philosophy as the pursuit of wisdom, which encompassed not only ethics and metaphysics but also natural philosophy, which would later become the sciences.

In fact, many of the greatest scientific minds in history were also philosophers. Aristotle, for instance, made significant contributions to the fields of biology, physics, and mathematics, while also writing extensively on ethics, politics, and metaphysics. Similarly, Isaac Newton's work on calculus and optics was deeply influenced by his philosophical views on the nature of reality and the universe.

The division of labor and the development of specialized disciplines has led to a more nuanced understanding of the different ways in which knowledge can be pursued. However, this has also led to a fragmentation of knowledge, where different fields are seen as separate and distinct, rather than as interconnected parts of a larger whole.

Perhaps the question is not whether science, mathematics, and historical research can be considered part of philosophy, but rather how we can integrate these different approaches to knowledge in a way that is meaningful and productive. By recognizing the commonalities between these disciplines, we can foster a more holistic understanding of the world and our place in it.

In this sense, philosophy can be seen as the foundation upon which all other disciplines are built. It provides the framework for understanding the nature of reality, the human condition, and the relationship between knowledge and truth. By engaging with philosophical questions and ideas, we can gain a deeper understanding of the world and our place in it, and develop a more nuanced and sophisticated approach to knowledge.

Ultimately, the pursuit of wisdom is a lifelong journey, and one that requires a willingness to engage with a wide range of disciplines and perspectives. By embracing the complexity and diversity of human knowledge, we can cultivate a deeper understanding of the world and our place in it, and develop a more profound appreciation for the beauty and mystery of existence."," and political science, etc...

I am picturing a Venn Diagram in my head of the different disciplines and where philosophy intersects with mathematics and economics and what have you.

So would you consider science, mathematics, economics etc... necessary tools to use in philosophy? How would the majority of academics define it?
Jurgioslakiv: We don't actually use the sciences etc to build theories of knowledge. We use them to build knowledge sets, but not to answer the question, ""What is knowledge?"" Philosophy tries to figure out what counts as knowledge, what are the requirements for something to be true, etc, which is quite different from what the sciences and other areas of study are doing.

At the core of every discipline lies philosophy though. At some point every discipline relies on philosophical tenets and axioms in order to start. The sciences for instance, rely on certain claims established in philosophy of science. So to that extent it's not as much that philosophy needs to use math, science, economics etc, but rather that all of those disciplines inherently use philosophy at their core.
Red_Marcus: ok, so philosophy provides us with the axioms we need to actually do the other disciplines.

The example I was thinking of Karl Marx's political philosophy. He developed a utopian system in his head, but had he used more empirical data or deductive reasoning (which doesn't deductive still count as philosophy?), maybe he would have trashed his model.

So I'm trying to understand to what extent philosophy is considered the establishment of axioms to build other areas of inquiry off of, and to what extent philosophy builds models off of these axioms. ""What is truth?"" would be considered axiomatic level and ""overthrow the proletariat"" is based off of many more assumptions, but they are both considered philosophy. 
yelbesed: As the marxist theories have caused hundreds of millions of death and oppression in his name I would not use him when I start out to define philosophy. In spite of some kind of rebel popularity of it in some corners.
Red_Marcus: Yeah maybe that was in bad taste. Don't take it the wrong way, I love capitalism. I was just trying to figure out what part of philosophy is the sort of theoretical foundation, ""what is truth"" kind of questions and what part of philosophy is the more practical (or in my example horrific) kind of questions like ""we should all share everything"".

The study included 30 soccer players with GP and 30 healthy controls. Participants underwent static and dynamic unipedal postural balance tests, and their results were compared to identify any asymmetry. The results showed that soccer players with GP exhibited significantly higher static and dynamic unipedal postural balance asymmetry compared to healthy controls. The asymmetry was more pronounced in the affected leg, indicating that the players with GP had altered postural control strategies to compensate for the pain.

Furthermore, the study found that the risk of subsequent noncontact lower extremity injuries was significantly higher in soccer players with GP compared to healthy controls. The risk was highest in players who exhibited the highest levels of postural balance asymmetry. These findings suggest that postural balance asymmetry may be a potential predictor of subsequent injuries in soccer players with GP.

The study's results have important implications for the prevention and treatment of noncontact lower extremity musculoskeletal injuries in soccer players with GP. Identifying postural balance asymmetry early on may allow for targeted interventions to improve postural control and reduce the risk of subsequent injuries. Additionally, the findings highlight the need for healthcare professionals to consider postural balance when assessing and managing patients with GP.

Future studies should investigate the relationship between postural balance asymmetry and other risk factors for noncontact lower extremity musculoskeletal injuries in soccer players with GP. Additionally, studies should examine the effectiveness of postural balance training programs in reducing the risk of subsequent injuries in these players.

They showed lower (p < 0.001) composite score for injured limb and higher (p < 0.001) side-to-side asymmetry in posteromedial reach distance compared to the cutoff values of 89.6 % and 4 cm, respectively. Moreover, GPG exhibited higher odds (OR= 7.48; 95 % CI = 2.15, 26.00; p < 0.01) of sustaining subsequent injuries compared to CG. Significance: The Y-BT should be instituted into existing pre-participation physical examinations to screen for soccer players with non-time loss GP at an elevated risk of sustaining subsequent injuries. This could help coaches and clinicians make valid return to play decisions."

As I mentioned earlier, my upper body pulling movements, particularly my pull-ups and rows, are not progressing as quickly as I would like. I've tried increasing the volume and intensity of my workouts, but I'm not seeing the same gains as I am with my lower body and core exercises.

I've been considering splitting my routine into upper and lower body days, as well as incorporating more pulling exercises to specifically target my latissimus dorsi and rhomboids. I've heard that splitting your routine can help to avoid plateaus and allow for more focused training, but I'm not sure if it's the right approach for me.

Has anyone else out there had success with splitting their routine? Do you have any tips or recommendations for how to structure your workouts to ensure that you're targeting all the major muscle groups?

I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this topic, and I'll be sure to keep you all updated on my progress as I experiment with different training methods.

Thanks in advance for your input, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts!

Best,

* inverted rows, 3x5 (not quite parallel to ground yet and stalled here for 2 weeks)
* chin ups, 3x5 (need about 20 lbs assist and stalled here for 2 weeks)

I've corrected for other issues like bad sleep or diet, and everything else is progressing steadily, so I don't know why my pulling movements aren't improving.

Would splitting my upper body work be a good idea? Perhaps alter acting push movements and pull movements each workout, or alternating horizontal plane and vertical plane?
jakehildreth: Pulling is much harder than all the other movements.  I was stuck on CC Pullup Step 2 for literally 6 months.  Just keep improving your form and/or adding reps slowly.  Slow progress is still progress.

It may be worth it to try doing your rows with bent knees working up to 3x8-10 before going back to straight legs.   Or stick with the straight legs, but raise the height of the row, work up to 3x8-10, then lower it just a bit.  Same thing with chins: give yourself more assistance until you reach 3x8-10, and then lower back down to 20 lbs. assist.  

One step backwards is okay if it allows you to take two steps forward.

Other options to help break your plateau: keep everything the same, but add a couple more sets to both pulling motions.  You aren't getting quite enough volume to really force adaptation.  Or try padding your set with slow negatives.  If you are only able to do 5 full-motion reps, add on 3 negatives at the end of each set.

BTW: for pistols, don't add band-assisting on only one side.  Do your weak side first until you fail.  Then do your strong side and stop when you reach the number of reps you were able to do on your weak side.  That is, if you can only do 2 reps on your left, don't do any more than 2 reps on your right side.  This will help you balance your strength. 

If you'd really want to stick with band-assist, be sure to band assist on the right too, but still don't exceed the reps performed on the left.
porkburp: Thanks for your help here! Sounds like you may have gone through the same issue as me. How are you doing with them now.

I'm due for a workout later today; I'm going to try adding 2 more sets and will likely have to add a bit more assistance to complete all of them. We'll see how that goes for the next 2 weeks and hopefully I can break that plateau.

As for pistols, I'm doing band-assisted on both sides to keep it even, but only require for the left side at present. And I'm very close to evening that imbalance out.
jakehildreth: My best for bar pull-ups was ~~3x8~~ 9,8,7,4 ~~back sometime in June or July~~ on August 1st before I really started bulking up.  (Getting fat makes pull-ups HARD!)

On Monday, I did 6,6,6,5,4 ring pull-ups.  Was aiming for 5x6 but couldn't quite keep it up for the whole session.  I normally shoot for 3 sets, but like you, I wasn't getting enough volume because I could only pull 4 or so reps at once.  You (generally) want a total of &gt;20 reps every session, even if that means adding more sets.

sad,id1234,human,", momentum, and energy equations are designed to preserve the positivity of these quantities. This is achieved through the use of flux limiters, which are applied to the discrete fluxes of the convection operators.

The choice of numerical scheme and the specific implementation details can significantly impact the accuracy and stability of the solution. For example, the use of higher-order numerical schemes, such as those based on finite elements or spectral methods, can provide more accurate solutions, but may also require more computational resources. On the other hand, the use of lower-order schemes, such as those based on finite differences, can be more computationally efficient, but may also be less accurate.

In addition to the numerical scheme, the choice of physical model and the specific implementation details can also impact the accuracy and stability of the solution. For example, the use of a compressible Euler equation model can provide a more accurate representation of the flow, but may also require more computational resources. On the other hand, the use of an incompressible Navier-Stokes equation model can be more computationally efficient, but may also be less accurate.

Overall, the development of numerical schemes for the solution of the Euler equations is an active area of research, with ongoing efforts to improve the accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency of these schemes."," and internal energy balance equations are carefully designed; they use an upwind technique with respect to the material velocity only. The construction of the fluxes thus does not need any Rie-mann or approximate Riemann solver, and yields easily implementable algorithms. The stability is obtained without restriction on the time step for the pressure correction scheme and under a CFL-like condition for explicit variants: preservation of the integral of the total energy over the computational domain, and positivity of the density and the internal energy. The semi-implicit first-order upwind scheme satisfies a local discrete entropy inequality. If a MUSCL-like scheme is used in order to limit the scheme diffusion, then a weaker property holds: the entropy inequality is satisfied up to a remainder term which is shown to tend to zero with the space and time steps, if the discrete solution is controlled in L $\infty$ and BV norms. The explicit upwind variant also satisfies such a weaker property, at the price of an estimate for the velocity which could be derived from the introduction of a new stabilization term in the momentum balance. Still for the explicit scheme, with the above-mentioned MUSCL-like scheme, the same result only holds if the ratio of the time to the space step tends to zero."

It seems like GroundhogExpert has made a strong case for foam cups being a more sustainable option, and ABDriversSuck is skeptical but willing to consider the evidence. Meanwhile, emitremmus27's initial post about New York City banning foam containers, coffee cups, and more remains a crucial context for this conversation.

The ban on foam containers, coffee cups, and more in New York City is a significant step towards reducing waste and promoting sustainability. However, it's essential to consider the potential consequences of such a ban. For instance, it may lead to an increase in the use of alternative materials that are not necessarily more eco-friendly. Additionally, the ban may disproportionately affect small businesses and low-income communities that rely heavily on single-use containers.

In response to GroundhogExpert's assertion that foam breaks down faster and is more easily processed to recycle, ABDriversSuck has requested a source to support this claim. GroundhogExpert has provided a link to a 2010 article on Recyclenation, which suggests that foam cups are indeed more easily recyclable than paper cups with plastic lining. However, it's crucial to note that the article is not a peer-reviewed scientific study, but rather an online article that may not be subject to the same rigorous standards of scientific inquiry.

Despite this limitation, GroundhogExpert's point about the potential benefits of foam cups is an important one. Foam cups are made from a type of plastic called polystyrene, which can be recycled and reused. In contrast, paper cups with plastic lining are often not recyclable and may end up in landfills or oceans.

As the conversation continues, it's essential to consider the broader implications of the ban on foam containers, coffee cups, and more. How will this ban affect the environment, the economy, and the daily lives of New Yorkers? What alternative materials and strategies will be used to replace foam containers, and will they be more or less sustainable? These are just a few of the questions that need to be addressed as we move forward with this landmark legislation.

In the end, the debate surrounding the ban on foam containers, coffee cups, and more in New York City highlights the complexity and nuance of environmental issues. While GroundhogExpert's point about the potential benefits of foam cups is an important one, it's also crucial to consider the potential drawbacks and unintended consequences of such a ban. By engaging in open and informed discussions, we can work towards finding solutions that balance our environmental goals with the needs and concerns of all stakeholders.","?

In our model, we simulate a scenario where individuals interact with each other in a repeated game, where cooperation is beneficial but also vulnerable to exploitation. We find that the presence of punishers and third-order cooperators can significantly increase cooperation rates, as they provide a deterrent to defectors and encourage cooperation. Additionally, we observe that the evolution of cooperation is facilitated by the presence of a cooperative founder population, which sets the stage for the emergence of cooperative behavior. Our results demonstrate that the evolutionary game theoretical approach can provide valuable insights into the evolution of cooperation and the development of strategies to promote cooperation in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, our findings have implications for the design of institutions and policies that aim to promote cooperation and address the tragedy of the commons."," free-riders""), cooperators who punish non-cooperative behavior (""moralists""), and defectors, who punish other defectors despite being non-cooperative themselves (""immoralists""). By considering spatial interactions with neighboring individuals, our model reveals several interesting effects: First, moralists can fully eliminate cooperators. This spreading of punishing behavior requires a segregation of behavioral strategies and solves the ""second-order free-rider problem"". Second, the system behavior changes its character significantly even after very long times (""who laughs last laughs best effect""). Third, the presence of a number of defectors can largely accelerate the victory of moralists over non-punishing cooperators. Forth, in order to succeed, moralists may profit from immoralists in a way that appears like an ""unholy collaboration"". Our findings suggest that the consideration of punishment strategies allows to understand the establishment and spreading of ""moral behavior"" by means of game-theoretical concepts. This demonstrates that quantitative biological modeling approaches are powerful even in domains that have been addressed with non-mathematical concepts so far. The complex dynamics of certain social behaviors becomes understandable as result of an evolutionary competition between different behavioral strategies."
sad,id947,human," model checkers can produce more complex counter-examples, such as computation trees or forests, to illustrate the violation of a property. These counter-examples can be particularly useful when dealing with systems that exhibit non-determinism or concurrency.

For instance, in a system with multiple agents, a branching counter-example could show how a particular property is violated by illustrating a computation tree where each branch represents a possible execution path of the system. This allows the user to visualize how the system can evolve in different ways, and how these different paths can lead to the violation of the property. In addition, branching counter-examples can also be used to identify the root cause of the problem, by highlighting the specific transition or decision point where the system diverges from the expected behavior.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing new model checking techniques and tools that can effectively handle complex systems with multiple agents, non-determinism, and concurrency. These techniques often rely on advanced algorithms and data structures, such as symbolic execution, constraint solving, and decision diagrams, to efficiently explore the vast search space of possible system behaviors. By providing more expressive and informative counter-examples, these techniques can help users to better understand the behavior of complex systems, and to identify and fix errors more effectively."," properties are only poorly and partially explained by a linear counter-example. This paper proposes richer counter-example structures called tree-like annotated counter-examples (TLACEs), for properties in Action-Restricted CTL (ARCTL), an extension of CTL quantifying paths restricted in terms of actions labeling transitions of the model. These counter-examples have a branching structure that supports more complete description of property violations. Elements of these counter-examples are annotated with parts of the property to give a better understanding of their structure. Visualization and browsing of these richer counter-examples become a critical issue, as the number of branches and states can grow exponentially for deeply-nested properties. This paper formally defines the structure of TLACEs, characterizes adequate counter-examples w.r.t. models and failed properties, and gives a generation algorithm for ARCTL properties. It also illustrates the approach with examples in CTLK, using a reduction of CTLK to ARCTL. The proposed approach has been implemented, first by extending the NuSMV model checker to generate and export branching counter-examples, secondly by providing an interactive graphical interface to visualize and browse them."

It sounds like you're experiencing a frustrating issue with leveling a single block on the ground. You've tried pounding the sand in and stomping it with a steel tamper, but the block still seems to be slightly unlevel. This is especially challenging when you try to level the block using a level on the cross beam, only to find that the cross beam itself is not level.

I can understand why this is a never-ending battle for you. It's like trying to hit a moving target! You're not alone in this struggle, though. Many people have faced similar challenges when trying to level heavy blocks or pavers.

One possible solution to consider is using a leveling compound, such as a sand-based mixture or a polymer-based product. These compounds can be applied to the ground before placing the block, and they can help to create a smooth, level surface. You can also try using a leveling tool, such as a rake or a trowel, to spread the compound evenly and ensure that it's level.

Another option is to use a block leveling kit, which typically includes a set of adjustable feet or shims that can be placed under the block to level it. These kits are designed specifically for leveling heavy blocks, and they can be adjusted to fit different block sizes and shapes.

If you're looking for a more permanent solution, you might consider installing a concrete slab or a paver patio. These can provide a solid, level surface for your block or pavers, and they can be designed to fit your specific needs and preferences.

In the meantime, I'd like to offer a few more suggestions to help you level your block. Have you tried using a laser level to ensure that the block is level? These devices can be very accurate and can help you achieve a precise level surface.

Another option is to use a leveling gauge, which is a tool that measures the levelness of a surface. You can place the gauge on the block and adjust it until it's level, then use it as a reference point to ensure that the block remains level.

Finally, if you're still having trouble leveling your block, you might consider consulting with a professional contractor or landscaper. They can provide expert advice and guidance on how to level your block, and they can help you avoid costly mistakes.

I hope these suggestions are helpful in your quest to level your block. Remember to stay patient and persistent, and don't be afraid to try new approaches until you find one that works for you. Good luck!"," on the 4x4 post, but our hardest challenge thus far is leveling the heavy cement deck blocks.
pw_15: I did a floating deck like this once. 
I was going to try and put the joists right in to the blocks but found the same issue, either the blocks themselves were unlevel, or unlevel from block to block. 

Finally I dug all the holes a good 6 inches to a foot deeper and put the blocks down. They were all at slightly different elevations and all slightly off level, but I put a post into them and built my deck off the posts, because after I had them all up I could go around and cut them all off at the same level. Using a post system was more forgiving than the joists because I could wiggle a post back and forth a bit within the block to get it in the right spot whereas the joists I could not, they would move the whole block.  

The deck block doesn't have to sit perfectly level if you are using posts. Pound it into place and then put the post in, and the post should have just enough wiggle room that you can level it separately. 
soul_system: I was researching these 4x4 posts + blocks now. Do the posts just sit down into the blocks without any additional fasteners? Is that not insecure?
SophieFrise: Yes, the 4x4 sit in the middle area and then you can bolt the frame to the post. Some use deck screws, but we will probably use lag screws to really secure it.  The deck with all the frame and the ribs and the deck boards should make it extremely heavy to where it isn't ""suppose"" to really move and it isn't like all the weight is in one area, but I guess there is always that chance depending on weather and soil etc.  In some cases, you don't have a choice, especially if your yard slopes like ours do.  So we will probably put a couple of them at that end where needed.  My choice for the part that can sit ground level is to have the frame on the actually cement deck blocks.  That is our preference, but for the life of us, we just can't get the deck blocks to level on the ground. That's why I was reaching out to see if anyone can do it better than we can.

 It seems almost impossible to level it.  So now, we are either going to dig a little lower, use flat pavers on top of our gravel/sand and level the pavers \(which should be easier than the heavy 50lb blocks\) and once that is level and seated to the ground, we will put our blocks on top of that and it should sit level.  Another option, again, dig a little lower and then we can use the 4x4 and have that come out of the ground and get as close to ground level as we can, but... honestly, having my entire frame on post that aren't cemented into the ground is not my first option.  I know folks that have their deck on post, but for the most part, the posts are cemented into the ground.

sad,id529,human," is any indication, we might be looking at a new standard for pec tear recovery.

I'm curious to know what others think about the approach Ido and his team took. Was it the combination of manual therapy, movement, and strength training that allowed Jonny to recover so quickly? Or was it the fact that Jonny is a highly motivated and dedicated individual? Maybe it's a combination of both.

It's also worth noting that Ido has been working with Jonny for a while now, and it's clear that they have a strong understanding of each other's goals and limitations. Ido has a reputation for being a master of movement and recovery, and it's clear that he knows what he's doing.

One thing that stood out to me was the emphasis on manual therapy in Jonny's rehab. Ido mentioned that he worked extensively with Jonny to release tension in his chest and shoulders, and that this was a crucial part of the recovery process. This makes sense, as tension in the chest and shoulders can be a major contributor to pain and limited mobility after a pec tear.

I'm also curious to know what others think about the role of strength training in Jonny's rehab. Ido mentioned that they started with very light weights and gradually increased the load as Jonny's strength and mobility improved. This approach makes sense, as it allows the individual to build strength and confidence gradually, without putting too much stress on the injured area.

Overall, I'm really impressed with the approach Ido and his team took with Jonny's rehab. It's clear that they are dedicated to helping their clients recover quickly and safely, and that they are willing to think outside the box and try new approaches to achieve this goal.

&gt; MRI diagnosed, full tear of the head. You can clearly see in the clip the deformity.

Let's take his word for it and not speculate whether it was a full tear.
AmazingEmmet: There's nothing remarkable in this rehab. I doubt the tear was over a grade 2 and surgery is rarely an option in that. The normal advice is once the bruising is down to move it ""to pain not through pain"" .  Johnny just took this advice to the max. You see this type of injury loads with powerlifters and they mke full recoveries with no surgery and no movement jerk
handstandguy: Maybe it's unremarkable to you but straddle planche after a week? One would think that the pec plays a bigger role in that skill. I would imagine he'd feel some degree of pain perfoming it. 
porkburp: I don't want to put words in Emmet's mouth but I think by ""unremarkable"" he's referring to the overall rehab strategy, not the application of it.

Keeping active, scaling your training to pain tolerance, and lots of low-load movement of the affected tissues is pretty standard advice across the board. Nothing new there.

It is perhaps cool to you that Johnny's low-load movement happens to be planche work. But for someone like him (I believe life-long gymnast, correct me if I'm wrong), planche work is beginner stuff. I, a female of average strength, might rehab the same with regular plank holds and wall pushups, which are beginner stuff for me.
handstandguy: I think it was the juxtaposition of him struggling with basic pushups and in the next clip performing a straddle planche that got me. Those two exercises are magnitudes of difficulty apart from each other.
porkburp: Indeed. It could be that the nature of this injury allowed him to continue performing many SAS movements but required him to scale back on the BAS. (I don't know - I'm not a doctor)

This also assumes that the video is even true. Remember, this is just another big advertisement for the business of the Ido Portal Method. They have great incentive to stretch the truth.
handstandguy: Perhaps I'm naive, but I'd like to think that the video is at least somewhat true. The bruising looked pretty genuine. I guess it's possible that the clips happened in reverse - the one arm chins were from much earlier and the injury happened just recently, haha.

As the centuries went by, the pyramids continued to captivate the imagination of people around the world. The Romans, who conquered Egypt in 30 BC, were particularly fascinated by the pyramids, and many of them made pilgrimages to see them. The pyramids were also a source of inspiration for many artists and writers, including the famous Italian artist Michelangelo, who designed a pyramid-shaped tomb for the Medici family in Florence.

In the 19th century, the pyramids underwent a major restoration project, led by the French engineer Auguste Mariette, who discovered the original entrance to the Great Pyramid of Giza. This project helped to uncover the secrets of the pyramids and restore them to their former glory. Today, the pyramids are one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world, with millions of people visiting them every year.

Despite the passage of time, the pyramids remain an enduring symbol of human ingenuity and creativity. They are a testament to the power of human imagination and the ability of people to create something truly remarkable. As we continue to marvel at the pyramids, we are reminded of the importance of preserving our cultural heritage and the need to continue exploring and discovering the secrets of the past."," reference, Islam was founded roughly 14 centuries ago from today.

Scac_ang_gaoic: That's wild.  Egypt lasted longer than most empires, no?

I feel like we weren't taught as much about the Egyptian timeline (not a history major)
arabic513: I’m not a history expert and I’d be interested to know the criteria of civilization vs empire. Rome is considered the longest empire (1200+ years), but Egypt is considered the longest civilization (3000+) 

Regardless though, the timescale of ancient Egypt and their civilization completely eclipse modern civilization.
twisted_meta: I might be able to answer this based on what I’ve learned taking anthropology courses. Civilization is basically the highest order in a 5 tier ranking system for a society. Basically in order to be considered a civilization there needs to be a high level of social stratification, employment specialization, urban centers, and a writing system. A civilization can also be an empire but an empire doesn’t need to be  full scale civilization. New World empires like the Olmec and Toltec are good examples of an empire that was not a civilization because they did not have written language and had tribal big man politics. Rome is the definition of a civilization that is also an empire…in this context Egypt should be considered both as their military might allowed for territorial gains under a single centralized power.
Scac_ang_gaoic: But they didn't have such centralized power?
twisted_meta: Centralized power meaning the Pharaoh and his court
Scac_ang_gaoic: I was thinking of the pharaoh's, I guess I mentally inserted an *if* a centralized power existed to the statement.

Still don't understand why Egypt wouldn't be on modern day history's lists for longest lasting empire.  Is it just territory size?
Jaooooooooooooooooo: Because it wasn't a singular empire for all that time. The central government collapsed on many occasions and they were rules by other empires as well.

For example, the Ptolemaic dynasty, which Cleopatra was part of, were Greek descendants of a companion of Alexander the Great (Ptolemy I)

It's also worth noting that the l-sit to tucked planche movement is a more dynamic exercise compared to the 60 second hold, as it requires you to generate force and control to transition between the two positions. This can help improve your power and explosiveness, which can be beneficial for other exercises and activities.

In terms of which one would have a greater effect on your ability to eventually do a planche, I would say that the 3x10 l-sit-&gt;tucked planche movement would be more beneficial. This is because the movement requires you to engage your core muscles and generate force to transition between the two positions, which is similar to what you would need to do when performing a planche.

The 60 second hold, on the other hand, is more focused on building endurance in the l-sit position, which while important, may not directly translate to improving your ability to perform a planche. However, building endurance in the l-sit position can still be beneficial, as it can help you maintain proper form and control when performing other exercises and activities.

Ultimately, both exercises can be beneficial for building core strength and endurance, and can be incorporated into your training routine to help improve your overall fitness and performance."," good for strength and hypertrophy in that rep range.

On a theoretical basis the 3x10 might burn more calories, but as I said it's not enough to matter. 
Grisnak: ty for the response. Incorporating both into my workout sounds like a good idea in light of your advice although I might wind up compromising slightly on both in the beginning, I imagine I'll get better at em with time.
himself1892: What's your goal? If you're going for full planche you could do both (yes it will be a compromise in the beginning), or you could alternate them between workouts. I myself would do a 30 second hold of adv. tuck planche (if you can) instead of 60s hold. It will build strength better.
Grisnak: &gt; Some background: I used to do pole vault and gymnastics in high school but then grades 11 and 12 saw me geting into warcraft and gaining several pounds. I was fairly obese, at 245 going into University. I cut that down in the last three years to about 180 now and have been getting into body weight exercises for the last 8 or so months. Got a pull up bar and been bustin em out every day along with chin ups and front lever progressions. Read parts of Christopher Sommer's ""Building the Gymnastic Body"" and got rings for my doorframe pull up bar exactly a month ago. Been having lots of fun with em :P 

My goal (well goals really) at this point are to be able to do a full planche, front lever, and back lever while cutting down some body fat%. I'm hovering at ~180 lbs and hoping to bring it to maybe 172-175. I've been doing lots of ring and bar work too for fat loss coupled with squat variations. Wind up working up quite a sweat with said dynamic movements. I got narrow L sit muscle ups down 3 weeks ago after 4 or so days of trying (forced to do L sit due to narrow door frame). 

I figure that with the right calorie deficient diet and progression training I'll be able to hopefully lose fat and achieve a planche, just looking for a few pointers on well rounded routines to those ends really :P Every person I've seen who can do a planche has had an incredibly toned midsection. I figured progressing to a planche would mean that by the time I was finally able to do one, my metabolism would have compensated and cut down fat in general due to the way the whole body is used in it. Been working on the ground so I can go and start doing it on the rings.

Her 4-month-old son weighed only five pounds - two less than at birth - and her daughter was in even worse shape. At 18 months, she weighed only 12 pounds, and soon lost four more.

&gt; When Dr. Jackson questioned the woman, who had 10 other children, he discovered that she had never breast-fed her two youngest. Their diets since birth had been infant formula. Because the family income averaged only $7 a week, the mother had to heavily dilute the expensive formula to make it last longer. ''For the 4-month-old baby,'' Dr. Jackson later told Senator Edward M. Kennedy's Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research, ''one tin of feed should have lasted for something just under three days. She said that one tin of feed lasted two weeks to feed both of the children.''

Moreover, it is also shown that if $\mathfrak{a}$ is a polynomial ideal of the principal class with $\mathfrak{a} \subset \mathfrak{q}$, then $\mathfrak{a}$ is also of the principal class and has multiplicity $d$ over $k$. This result is quite surprising, as it suggests that the multiplicity of a primary ideal of the principal class is determined by the associated prime ideal. Furthermore, it is also shown that the multiplicity of a primary ideal of the principal class is independent of the choice of the polynomial ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ of the principal class with $\mathfrak{a} \subset \mathfrak{q}$.

In this paper, we will explore the implications of this result on the theory of algebraic geometry. We will show that the multiplicity of a primary ideal of the principal class is a fundamental invariant of the associated prime ideal, and that it plays a crucial role in the study of the geometry of algebraic varieties. We will also discuss the connections between the multiplicity of a primary ideal of the principal class and the theory of Hilbert functions, and we will show that the result of Macaulay has far-reaching implications for the study of algebraic geometry.","(k[\chi]/({\chi}\_1$,...,${\chi}\_n)^2)=n+1$ because, passing to a system of PD equations for one unknown $y$, the parametric jets are \{${y,y\_1, ...,y\_n}$\} but any ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ of the principal class with $\mathfrak{a}\subset ({\chi}\_1,{\^a},{\chi}\_n)^2$ is contained into a {\it simple} ideal, that is a primary ideal $\mathfrak{q}$ such that $rad(\mathfrak{q})=\mathfrak{m}\in max(k[\chi])$ is a maximal and thus prime ideal with $dim\_k(M)=dim\_k(k[\chi]/\mathfrak{q})=2^n$ at least. Accordingly, any primary ideal $\mathfrak{q}$ may not be a member of the primary decomposition of an unmixed ideal $\mathfrak{a} \subseteq \mathfrak{q}$ of the principal class. Otherwise, $\mathfrak{q}$ is said to be of the {\it principal noetherian class} "". Our aim is to explain this result in a modern language and to illustrate it by providing a similar example for $n=4$. The importance of such an example is that it allows for the first time to exhibit symbols which are $2,3,4$-acyclic without being involutive. Another interest of this example is that it has properties quite similar to the ones held by the system of conformal Killing equations which are still not known. For this reason, we have put all the examples at the end of the paper and each one is presented in a rather independent way though a few among them are quite tricky. Meanwhile, the second purpose is to prove that the methods developped by Macaulay in order to study {\it unmixed polynomial ideals} are only particular examples of new formal differential geometric techniques that have been introduced recently in order to study {\it pure differential modules}.

When I got back home, my dad was already done with the door and was starting on the rest of the fence. I showed him the new hinges and told him what the guy at the store said about them.

I was a bit disappointed, but I understood his point. So we continued with the original hinges, and after a few more hours of work, we finally finished the fence. It looked great, and my dad was proud of the job we did.

As we were putting away the tools, my dad turned to me and said, ""You know, I'm glad we did this together. It's not just about fixing a fence, it's about spending time together and making memories."" I agreed, and we both knew that this was something we would always cherish.

Edit : Also, if there's any suggestions on removing screws from a post that broke off and have been cut flush to the wood, I would love them.
jakkarth: Use vice grip pliers to remove the broken screw. Screws will last a lot longer than nails if you can manage to get them installed. The kind of screws you want are ""decking"" or ""exterior coated"" screws. If you have trouble driving them in, use a 1/8"" drill bit to predrill the holes. Go about the length of the screw minus half an inch deep with the drill bit, then drive the screw in the hole.
[deleted]: Yeah, no exterior coated anything. A few rust coated screws about the same size/shape that I could clean off. 

The nails are left-overs from when we (my neighbors and beer) put together a patio, but I can only assume (because the neighbour got them, not us) that they were rated for outdoors.
jakkarth: If they're not coated, they'll rot/rust. That'll lead to poor structural performance (your fence falls apart) and discoloration (black stains trailing down from the screw heads). In some cases the exterior rated screws are also stronger than their interior counterparts.
[deleted]: What i'm taking from that is ""Exterior coated nails, though inferior to exterior coated screws, are preferable to interior coated screws""?
jakkarth: That is my recommendation, yes. I would not build a fence for my mother using anything less than exterior coated screws, but given a choice between galvanized/exterior nails and drywall/interior screws, I'd go with the nails.
[deleted]: Thanks, your mother is a lucky lady. I'm going to grab some exterior screws later in the day, and make sure to drill in some holes before I try to install 'em.

Also, the pliers didn't work to pull out the screw, it just stripped the screw more. So I cut it off. Is that ""ok"", or are there screw-removal pliers is should look into?
jakkarth: I'd probably leave it. The [vice grip](http://tungstencarbidefacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/vicegrip.jpg) pliers are my go-to for removing screws with broken-off heads, so if that didn't work you're probably better off just cutting it off. Good luck!

With multi-tier programming, the programmer can write the server-side code, the client-side code, and the database interactions in the same language, making it easier to maintain and update the application. This approach also enables the programmer to take advantage of the strengths of each tier, such as the ability of the server-side language to handle complex business logic and the ability of the client-side language to provide a rich user interface. Additionally, multi-tier programming can help to reduce the complexity of the application, making it easier to debug and test.

One of the key benefits of multi-tier programming is that it allows the programmer to write the application in a more modular and scalable way. The application can be divided into smaller components, each of which can be developed and tested independently. This makes it easier to maintain and update the application over time, as changes can be made to individual components without affecting the rest of the application. Multi-tier programming also enables the programmer to take advantage of the strengths of each tier, such as the ability of the server-side language to handle complex business logic and the ability of the client-side language to provide a rich user interface.

Another advantage of multi-tier programming is that it provides a more flexible and adaptable application architecture. The application can be easily modified to meet changing requirements, as the different tiers can be updated independently. This makes it easier to respond to changing business needs and to adapt the application to new technologies and trends. Multi-tier programming also enables the programmer to take advantage of the strengths of each tier, such as the ability of the server-side language to handle complex business logic and the ability of the client-side language to provide a rich user interface.

In conclusion, multi-tier or tierless programming is a web programming paradigm that provides one language for the different tiers of the web application, allowing the programmer to focus on the actual logic of the application rather than the technical details of the different tiers. This approach provides a more modular and scalable application architecture, as well as a more flexible and adaptable application architecture. It also enables the programmer to take advantage of the strengths of each tier, such as the ability of the server-side language to handle complex business logic and the ability of the client-side language to provide a rich user interface."," program logic instead of the accidental complexity that comes from combining several technologies. While current tierless approaches therefore relieve the burden of having to combine different technologies into one application, the distribution of the code is explicitly tied into the program. Certain distribution decisions have an impact on crosscutting concerns such as information security or offline availability. Moreover, adapting the programs such that the application complies better with these concerns often leads to code tangling, rendering the program more difficult to understand and maintain. We introduce an approach to multi-tier programming where the tierless code is decoupled from the tier specification. The developer implements the web application in terms of slices and an external specification that assigns the slices to tiers. A recommender system completes the picture for those slices that do not have a fixed placement and proposes slice refinements as well. This recommender system tries to optimise the tier specification with respect to one or more crosscutting concerns. This is in contrast with current cutting edge solutions that hide distribution decisions from the programmer. In this paper we show that slices, together with a recommender system, enable the developer to experiment with different placements of slices, until the distribution of the code satisfies the programmer's needs. We present a search-based recommender system that maximises the offline availability of a web application and a concrete implementation of these concepts in the tier-splitting tool Stip.js."

The presence of a high-spin Fe(3+) ion is consistent with the idea that the peroxo-iron species is a high-spin side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) complex.

The EPR spectra exhibit a characteristic signal at g = 2.0, which is typical for high-spin Fe(3+) ions. The EPR spectra also exhibit a signal at g = 4.3, which is consistent with the presence of a peroxo ligand. The EPR spectra suggest that the peroxo-iron species is a high-spin side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) complex.

The results of the M{\""o}ssbauer and EPR studies are consistent with the results of density functional calculations on related models.

The M{\""o}ssbauer and spin Hamiltonian parameters have been evaluated on a model from the side-on peroxo complex (model 2) issued from the oxidized iron center in SOR from Pyrococcus furiosus, for which structural data are available in the literature [Yeh et al. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 2499-2508]. For comparison, similar calculations have been carried out on a model derived from 2 (model 3), where the [CH(3)-S](1)(-) group has been replaced by the neutral [NH(3)](0) group [Neese and Solomon (1998) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120, 12829-12848]. Both models 2 and 3 contain a formally high-spin Fe(3+) ion (i.e., with empty minority spin orbitals). We found, however, a significant fraction (approximately 0.6 for 2, approximately 0.8 for 3) of spin (equivalently charge) spread over two occupied (minority spin) orbitals. The quadrupole splitting value for 2 is found to be negative and matches quite well the experimental value. The computed quadrupole tensors are rhombic in the case of 2 and axial in the case of 3. This difference originates directly from the presence of the thiolate ligand in 2. A correlation between experimental isomer shifts for Fe(3+) mononuclear complexes with computed electron densities at the iron nucleus has been built and used to evaluate the isomer shift values for 2 and 3 (0.56 and 0.63 mm/s, respectively). A significant increase of isomer shift value is found upon going from a methylthiolate to a nitrogen ligand for the Fe(3+) ion, consistent with covalency effects due to the presence of the axial thiolate ligand. Considering that the isomer shift value for 3 is likely to be in the 0.61-0.65 mm/s range [Horner et al. (2002) Eur. J. Inorg. Chem., 3278-3283], the isomer shift value for a high-spin eta(2)-O(2) Fe(3+) complex with an axial thiolate group can be estimated to be in the 0.54-0.58 mm/s range. The occurrence of a side-on peroxo intermediate in SOR is discussed in relation to the recent data published for a side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) species in another biological system [Karlsson et al. (2003) Science 299, 1039-1042]."
sad,id930,human," order to optimize the team's overall performance. In this approach, we leverage the strengths of both BDI and POMDP frameworks to develop a more effective and efficient role allocation strategy.

Our hybrid approach involves two main components: a BDI team planner and a POMDP-based role allocator. The BDI team planner is responsible for generating a set of possible team plans, each representing a different allocation of agents to roles. The POMDP-based role allocator, on the other hand, uses these plans to determine the optimal allocation of agents to roles, taking into account the uncertainty and partial observability of the environment. By combining these two components, we can efficiently explore the space of possible team plans and identify the optimal allocation that maximizes the team's performance.

In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach in a variety of scenarios, including a simulated rescue mission and a real-world logistics scenario. Our results show that our approach outperforms traditional BDI team planners and POMDP-based role allocators, and provides a more robust and adaptive solution to the role allocation problem. Overall, our hybrid BDI-POMDP approach provides a powerful tool for solving complex multiagent team planning problems, and has the potential to be applied in a wide range of domains, from autonomous systems to human-robot teams."," the team. The article provides three key contributions. First, we describe a role allocation technique that takes into account future uncertainties in the domain; prior work in multiagent role allocation has failed to address such uncertainties. To that end, we introduce RMTDP (Role-based Markov Team Decision Problem), a new distributed POMDP model for analysis of role allocations. Our technique gains in tractability by significantly curtailing RMTDP policy search; in particular, BDI team plans provide incomplete RMTDP policies, and the RMTDP policy search fills the gaps in such incomplete policies by searching for the best role allocation. Our second key contribution is a novel decomposition technique to further improve RMTDP policy search efficiency. Even though limited to searching role allocations, there are still combinatorially many role allocations, and evaluating each in RMTDP to identify the best is extremely difficult. Our decomposition technique exploits the structure in the BDI team plans to significantly prune the search space of role allocations. Our third key contribution is a significantly faster policy evaluation algorithm suited for our BDI-POMDP hybrid approach. Finally, we also present experimental results from two domains: mission rehearsal simulation and RoboCupRescue disaster rescue simulation."

The syncretic practices and beliefs of Shinbutsu-shūgō continued to evolve over the centuries, with various sects and schools emerging. For example, the Tendai school of Buddhism, which was introduced from China in the 9th century, incorporated Shinto elements into its teachings and rituals. Similarly, the Shingon school of Buddhism, which was introduced from India in the 9th century, also incorporated Shinto elements into its teachings and rituals.

Despite the efforts of the Meiji government to separate Shinto and Buddhism, many Japanese people continued to practice Shinbutsu-shūgō in secret. In fact, the syncretic practices and beliefs of Shinbutsu-shūgō continued to influence Japanese culture and society well into the 20th century. Today, many Japanese people continue to practice Shinbutsu-shūgō in various forms, and the syncretic practices and beliefs of this tradition continue to play an important role in Japanese culture and society."," figures. The local religion and foreign Buddhism never fused into a single, unified religion, but remained inextricably linked to the present day through interaction. The depth of the influence from Buddhism on local religious beliefs can be seen in much of Shinto's conceptual vocabulary and even the types of Shinto shrines seen today. The large worship halls and religious images are themselves of Buddhist origin. The formal separation of Buddhism from Shinto took place only as recently as the end of the 19th century; however, in many ways, the blending of the two still continues.
The term shinbutsu shūgō itself was coined during the early modern era (17th century) to refer to the amalgamation of kami and buddhas in general, as opposed to specific currents within Buddhism which did the same, e.g. Ryōbu Shintō and Sannō Shintō. The term may have a negative connotation of bastardization and randomness. It is a yojijukugo phrase.

The proposed model is based on the assumption that the airflow passes through the reed in a laminar flow regime, which is a reasonable assumption for most free reed instruments. The reed is modeled as a flat plate with a small thickness, and the airflow is modeled as a steady flow with a constant velocity. The airflow is assumed to be incompressible and irrotational, and the reed is assumed to be a rigid body.

The proposed model is used to simulate the behavior of a free reed instrument, such as an accordion or a harmonica, and to investigate the effects of the reed thickness and the airflow velocity on the instrument's sound quality. The model is also used to study the effects of the reed's shape and size on the instrument's sound quality.

The results of the simulations show that the reed thickness and the airflow velocity have a significant impact on the instrument's sound quality. The reed thickness affects the instrument's tone and the airflow velocity affects the instrument's pitch. The simulations also show that the reed's shape and size have a significant impact on the instrument's sound quality, with different shapes and sizes producing different tones and pitches.

In conclusion, the proposed model is a minimal model for free reeds that takes into account the significant phenomena and can be used to build models of free reed instruments which permit numerical simulations. The model is used to investigate the effects of the reed thickness and the airflow velocity on the instrument's sound quality, and the results of the simulations show that these parameters have a significant impact on the instrument's sound quality."," to illustrate, with temporal simulations, the minimal model for both kinds of reeds and to discuss the model assumptions. Some clues are given about the influence, on the playing frequency and on the dynamic of the sound, of two main parameters of the geometrical model: the size of the volume and the level of the excitation. It is shown that the playing frequency of a (+,-) reed can vary in a large range according to the size of the volume upstream of the reed; that the playing frequency is nearly independent of the excitation but that the dynamic of the sound increases with the excitation level. Some clues are also proposed to determine the nature of the bifurcation for free reeds: it seems that free reeds may present inverse bifurcations. The influence of the reed thickness is also studied for configurations where the reed length or the reed width vary to keep the mass constant. This study shows that the reed thickness can have a great influence on the sound magnitude, the playing frequency and the magnitude of the reed displacement which justifies its introduction in the reed model.This article has been published in Acta Acustica united with Acustica, Vol. 93 (2007), p. 122-144."

I’m not saying that all of the people there will be introverts but very often they have wholesome communities that are extremely accepting to all individuals. 

Some examples (from personal experience) is the Goth community (but stay very clear from the Emo community as they can be very toxic) and the Warhammer miniature (creating/painting/playing) community. Just avoid any competitive gaming.

I want to feel alive I am dead right now.
Zavke: Wow, quite an aggressive answer from a self proclaimed introvert. Get of your high horse judging communities you haven’t experienced for yourself and calm down because it sounds like you want to be able to run without even knowing how to crawl first. 

Just ignore my second point, you desperately and urgently need therapy in order to function like a normal person in society.
hikingaustin: I am sorry I don't meant to be rude there. But you are the only one who understood what's wrong with me (very happy that you understood me). Yeah I need to be calm first. What should I do? I blurt out random things. My thoughts are not even organised. You said rightly I don't think and act like a normal human being. My emotions are dead. I pinpoint small things out (I constantly search for perfection in others but I am callous myself) , I judge others badly (but I won't say to them). I am insane but I am not a bad guy at all.
Zavke: I wouldn’t call you insane by any means. In fact your story/situation reminds me of one I’ve experienced myself and seen happen to multiple people that I know. Don’t focus on the end goal but try to enjoy the journey, otherwise you’ll just remain frustrated and unfulfilled since reaching those goals will just leave you feeling empty afterwards (again, speaking from experience)

Take my advice and get therapy. It’s the gonna be hard work (I won’t sugarcoat it) but it remains the fastest and easiest way to a better life and better you. 

There are other ways but they will require much more personal discipline that you seem to be able to muster at the moment. 

And never underestimate the positive influence of a wholesome community, one of the first things you will have to let go of are any preconceived notions and prejudices you have against anyone and any thing.

In this context, we provide a quasi-linear time algorithm for computing the diameter of a split graph with a bounded clique-interval number, which is a significant improvement over the known quadratic time algorithms. Our algorithm is based on a careful analysis of the structure of the graph, and it relies on a combination of graph theoretical and combinatorial techniques. We also show that the complement of a split graph with a bounded clique-interval number is still a split graph, and we provide a quasi-linear time algorithm for computing the diameter of such graphs as well.

Our results have important implications for the study of the complexity of diameter computation on split graphs, and they provide a new perspective on the relationship between the clique-interval number and the diameter of a graph. Moreover, our algorithms can be used to solve other problems related to graph diameter, such as the computation of the eccentricity of a graph, which is an important problem in computer science and graph theory.

Furthermore, our results can be extended to other subclasses of split graphs, and they provide a new direction for research in the field of graph algorithms. In particular, we can consider the study of the complexity of diameter computation on other subclasses of split graphs, such as the class of split graphs with bounded clique-width, or the class of split graphs with bounded tree-width. These are important research directions that can provide new insights into the complexity of graph algorithms and the structure of graphs.

In conclusion, our results provide a significant improvement over the known algorithms for computing the diameter of split graphs, and they open up new research directions in the field of graph algorithms. We believe that our results will have important implications for the study of graph diameter and will provide new insights into the complexity of graph algorithms."," variation of the concept of interval number for split graphs that we introduce in this paper. We first discuss the relations between the clique-interval number and other graph invariants such as the classic interval number of graphs, the treewidth, the {\em VC-dimension} and the {\em stabbing number} of a related hypergraph. Then, in part based on these above relations, we almost completely settle the complexity of diameter computation on these subclasses of split graphs: - For the $k$-clique-interval split graphs, we can compute their diameter in truly subquadratic time if $k={\cal O}(1)$, and even in quasi linear time if $k=o(\log{n})$ and in addition a corresponding ordering of the vertices in the clique is given. However, under SETH this cannot be done in truly subquadratic time for any $k = \omega(\log{n})$. - For the {\em complements} of $k$-clique-interval split graphs, we can compute their diameter in truly subquadratic time if $k={\cal O}(1)$, and even in time ${\cal O}(km)$ if a corresponding ordering of the vertices in the stable set is given. Again this latter result is optimal under SETH up to polylogarithmic factors. Our findings raise the question whether a $k$-clique interval ordering can always be computed in quasi linear time. We prove that it is the case for $k=1$ and for some subclasses such as bounded-treewidth split graphs, threshold graphs and comparability split graphs.

He asked his driver to stop unscheduled at a second supermarket. It was just as abundant. Capitalism was a success and the cadres knew it. Their historic aspiration for world leadership sagged.

According to *Sources*, the early days of industrialization and military buildup were very successful, bringing high economic growth and especially education.

As the debate rages on, it's essential to acknowledge the complexities involved. The Native American tribe has a legitimate concern about preserving their cultural heritage, and the Texan family is trying to provide a loving home for the children. However, the issue at hand is not just about providing a better life for the children but also about respecting the rights and traditions of the Native American tribe. The tribe has a deep connection with their land and culture, and the children are an integral part of that.

The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) was enacted to address the historical trauma and cultural destruction inflicted upon Native American communities. The law aims to keep Native American children with their families and communities, rather than separating them from their cultural roots. The Texan family's adoption of the Native American children could be seen as a threat to this cultural preservation.

It's crucial to recognize that the Texan family is not maliciously trying to erase the Native American culture. They are simply trying to provide a loving home for the children. However, the issue is not just about the family's intentions but also about the potential consequences of their actions. The separation of the brother and sister, as well as the potential loss of their cultural identity, could have long-lasting effects on their well-being and sense of belonging.

As the debate continues, it's essential to find a solution that respects the rights and traditions of both the Texan family and the Native American tribe. Perhaps a compromise could be reached, such as allowing the Texan family to adopt the children while also ensuring that they are raised with a strong connection to their Native American culture. This could involve regular visits with their extended family, cultural immersion programs, and education about their Native American heritage.

By working together, it's possible to find a solution that respects the rights and traditions of all parties involved."," corrected
lexabear: I fault the Texan family. I don't believe they're acting maliciously, but that doesn't mean that they can't be faulted. They assume that the only way to help these children is for *them* to take them away from their family and raise them themselves. 

Specifically, this quote where the adoptive family discusses adopting the child's sister from the original family:
&gt; I’m a little bit concerned with the limited financial resources possibly to care for this child, should an emergency come up.

Another solution would be to *provide a better social net for the original family*, not just to take their children because they're poor. And yet that solution doesn't even seem to be on the table. 

To say ""I have more money for you, so I can do a better job bringing up your children, so I should be able to take them"" is imperialism at its worst. Should a Russian oligarch have been able to just take me away from my parents, because they had more money?
crouching_tiger: But they aren’t taking the child away from *his* family, they fostered the child after the state took him from his mother due to drug use.

They tried to adopt him, but a law is in place giving preference to native tribes over anyone else to then adopt. 

The wealth argument is entirely separate. They are just arguing they could provide a better life than the other native family that wanted to adopt him.

The agent-based model used in this study is designed to simulate the evacuation of pedestrians during an earthquake. The model is based on the concept of agent-based modeling, which is a type of computational modeling that focuses on the behavior of individual agents or entities that interact with each other and their environment. In this case, the agents are pedestrians, and their behavior is influenced by factors such as their location, speed, and direction of movement. The model also takes into account the physical environment, including the layout of the city, the presence of obstacles, and the condition of the infrastructure.

The model is applied to the city of Beirut, which is a densely populated urban area with a complex network of streets and buildings. The city has a rich history, with many ancient buildings and monuments that are at risk of damage or collapse during an earthquake. The model is used to simulate the evacuation of pedestrians during a hypothetical earthquake, and the results are compared to the actual evacuation times and routes used by pedestrians during a real earthquake.

The results of the study show that the agent-based model is able to accurately simulate the evacuation of pedestrians during an earthquake. The model is able to capture the complex behavior of pedestrians, including their speed, direction of movement, and ability to adapt to changing circumstances. The results also show that the model is able to accurately predict the evacuation times and routes used by pedestrians during a real earthquake.

The study also highlights the importance of considering the social aspect of risk in seismic risk assessment. The model shows that the behavior of pedestrians during an earthquake is influenced by factors such as their location, speed, and direction of movement, as well as their social and cultural background. The study also highlights the importance of considering the physical environment, including the layout of the city, the presence of obstacles, and the condition of the infrastructure.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of agent-based modeling for simulating the evacuation of pedestrians during earthquakes at the city scale. The model is able to accurately capture the complex behavior of pedestrians and predict the evacuation times and routes used by pedestrians during a real earthquake. The study also highlights the importance of considering the social aspect of risk in seismic risk assessment, and the need for a more comprehensive approach to risk assessment that takes into account the behavior of individuals and the physical environment."," being in 1759. It is one of the countries with the highest seismic risk in the Mediterranean region. This is due to the high seismic vulnerability of the buildings due to the absence of mandatory seismic regulation until 2012, the high level of urbanization, and the lack of adequate spatial planning and risk prevention policies. Beirut as the main residential, economic and institutional hub of Lebanon is densely populated. To accommodate the growing need for urban development, constructions have almost taken over all of the green areas of the city; squares and gardens are disappearing to give place to skyscrapers. However, open spaces are safe places to shelter, away from debris, and therefore play an essential role in earthquake evacuation. Despite the massive urbanization, there are a few open spaces but locked gates and other types of anthropogenic barriers often limit their access. To simulate this complex context, pedestrians' evacuation simulations are run in a highly realistic spatial environment implemented in GAMA [1]. Previous data concerning soil and buildings in Beirut [2, 3] are complemented by new geographic data extracted from high-resolution Pleiades satellite images. The seismic loading is defined as a peak ground acceleration of 0.3g, as stated in Lebanese seismic regulations. Building damages are estimated using an artificial neural network trained to predict the mean damage [4] based on the seismic loading as well as the soil and building vibrational properties [5]. Moreover, the quantity and the footprint of the generated debris around each building are also estimated and included in the model. We simulate how topography, buildings, debris, and access to open spaces, affect individuals' mobility. Two city configurations are implemented: 1. Open spaces are accessible without any barriers; 2. Access to some open spaces is blocked. The first simulation results show that while 52% of the population is able to arrive to an open space within 5 minutes after an earthquake, this number is reduced to 39% when one of the open spaces is locked. These results show that the presence of accessible open spaces in a city and their proximity to the residential buildings is a crucial factor for ensuring people's safety when an earthquake occurs."

The defeat at Bystrzyk was a significant blow to the Polish forces, as it allowed the Bolsheviks to gain a foothold in the region and push deeper into Ukrainian territory. The Polish 2nd and 3rd Armies were now in grave danger of being encircled and cut off from their supply lines, and it seemed as though the Bolsheviks were on the verge of a major breakthrough.

Despite the setback, the Polish forces refused to give up. They regrouped and launched a series of counterattacks against the Bolsheviks, determined to retake the initiative and push the enemy back. The fighting was intense and brutal, with both sides suffering heavy casualties as they clashed in a series of fierce battles across the Ukrainian countryside.

In the end, the Polish forces managed to hold their ground and prevent the Bolsheviks from encircling them. However, the defeat at Bystrzyk had come at a great cost, and the Polish army was now weakened and demoralized. The battle had also had a significant impact on the local population, who had been caught in the middle of the conflict and were now forced to live under the harsh rule of the Bolsheviks.

Despite the challenges they faced, the Polish forces continued to fight on, determined to defend their country and their way of life. They knew that the outcome of the war was far from certain, and that the fate of their nation hung in the balance. But they were also driven by a deep sense of patriotism and a determination to prove themselves worthy of their ancestors, who had fought and died for their country in the past.",", all 75 Poles were killed, including prisoners and wounded in action. The exact Russian losses are unknown. Shortly after the skirmish, the commander of the Polish 13th Infantry Division, Gen. Franciszek Paulik, dispatched the reserve Polish 40th Infantry Regiment, but it was too late to relieve the defenders of Bystryk and the regiment lacked enough firepower to defeat an entire division. Because of that, the Polish tactical counter-offensive was repelled. The following day, the Russian division expanded the gap, broke through to the other side of the front and managed to drive approximately 15 kilometres towards the rear of the Polish forces.
This created a gap in the Polish front and endangered the rear of the Polish 13th division. The commander of the Polish 6th Army, Gen. Wacław Iwaszkiewicz, ordered a counter-assault group to be created out of all available reserves. The group, commanded by Jerzy Sawicki, was composed of two regiments of his 3rd Cavalry Brigade, as well as two infantry battalions from the 19th Infantry Regiment and two batteries of field artillery. The Polish counter-assault started at 1 o'clock in the night of 1 June 1920. The Poles caught the 11th Cavalry Division by surprise in the village of Starościńce. Although the forces of both sides were more or less equal, the surprise was decisive and the Russians sounded a retreat after a short skirmish. After a successful pursuit, the 11th Division was forced back to its original positions from before the offensive started.

sad,id603,human," list goes on. The scientific community has amassed an overwhelming amount of evidence supporting the theory of evolution. From the fossil record to comparative anatomy, the evidence is clear: species evolve over time through the process of natural selection.

But what about the skeptics? The ones who claim that evolution is just a theory, and that it's not supported by empirical evidence? Well, let me tell you, they're wrong. Evolution is a fact, and the evidence is there for anyone to see.

Take, for example, the peppered moth. Before the Industrial Revolution, the moth had a light-colored, speckled appearance that allowed it to blend in with the lichen-covered trees it rested on. But as the trees became darker due to pollution, a genetic variation in the moth population caused some individuals to have a dark-colored appearance. These moths were better camouflaged on the dark trees and had a selective advantage, which led to an increase in their population.

This is just one example of how evolution has shaped the natural world. From the adaptation of finches on the Galapagos Islands to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, evolution is all around us.

And yet, despite the overwhelming evidence, there are still those who deny the theory of evolution. They claim that it's just a theory, and that it's not supported by empirical evidence. But the truth is, evolution is a fact, and the evidence is there for anyone to see.

So, the next time someone tells you that evolution is just a theory, you can set them straight. You can tell them that evolution is a fact, and that the evidence is there for anyone to see. And if they still don't believe you, you can always point them to the overwhelming amount of evidence that supports the theory of evolution.

In the end, it's not about whether or not you believe in evolution. It's about understanding the natural world and the processes that shape it. And if you're willing to look at the evidence, you'll see that evolution is a fact that's hard to ignore."," Answer Key: Evidence of Evolution](https://www.studocu.com/en-us/document/university-of-chicago/biological-evolution/evidence-of-evolution-answer-key/14038735)

sad,id1668,human,", I would recommend finding a local park or outdoor space that has a decent area for doing bodyweight exercises. You can do push-ups, squats, lunges, and other exercises that don't require any equipment. This will help you maintain some level of fitness and strength while you're working remotely.

In addition, you can also consider investing in some resistance bands or a portable pull-up bar that you can set up in your home or backyard. These can be a great way to add some variety to your workouts and still challenge yourself even without access to a gym.

Another option is to look into online personal training or fitness coaching services that offer virtual training sessions. This way, you can still get professional guidance and support while working remotely. Many gyms and fitness studios are now offering virtual classes and training sessions, so you can stay active and motivated even from the comfort of your own home.

It's also important to remember that consistency is key when it comes to weightlifting and fitness. Even with limited equipment or access to a gym, you can still make progress and see results if you stick to a regular workout routine. So, don't get discouraged if you can't get to the gym as often as you'd like. Instead, focus on finding creative ways to stay active and engaged, and you'll be back to your peak performance in no time.

In the long term, once the gyms reopen, you can reassess your fitness goals and find a program that works best for you. You can also consider working with a personal trainer or fitness coach to help you create a customized workout plan that meets your specific needs and goals.

Remember, the most important thing is to stay committed to your fitness journey and find ways to stay active and engaged, even in the face of challenges like working remotely or gym closures. With the right mindset and a little creativity, you can achieve your fitness goals and reach peak performance, no matter what life throws your way."," finding a gym close by should be relatively easy unless you live in the middle of nowhere.
thirtyhours_: Nah I feel you it’s just not something I can do right now.

Is that really true though? Like I have a dumbbell set, a barbell set already and can get a power tower. I was leaning towards a dumbbell and bodyweight/calisthenics focused program. Imo, with those three sets of equipment I won’t be hitting a bottleneck for years.
dolomiten: Did I overlook you mentioning having a barbell or did you not mention it in the post? If you’ve got a barbell then sure, you should be fine. I’d strongly recommend trying to get a squat rack instead of a power tower if you have space. I’ve had a power tower and they’re okay but having a squat rack will open up a lot more options. 

Regarding your original question, I don’t know if you’ll find what you’re looking for. I don’t know anything that lays things out to that extent. There are online things for lifting but if you specifically want calisthenics worked in (and I assume that you’re talking about doing more than just basic movements as assistance work) that typically involves some tweaking on your part. 

Some lifting programs are more customisable than others. I’m doing Average to Savage 2 by Greg Nuckols for example which is highly customisable. It wouldn’t be difficult to work callisthenics and dumbbell stuff into it. Another option (that I haven’t done but am confident would work) is doing 5/3/1 Ain’t Doing Jack (I’d have to double check the template name) from the second edition book. It’s a four day program with a main lift each day and then you’d add whatever callisthenics and dumbbell stuff you wanted to that. I’m sure there are plenty of other options but those are the ones that come to mind. 

You wouldn’t need to pay anything on an ongoing basic. It would take a bit of time to get accustomed to your assistance work but the main work would all be laid out in a spreadsheet.
thirtyhours_: Gotcha, will check these out. No you didn’t miss it I just forgot to mention it.

Appreciate the advice. Why the squat rack vs a power tower? I think ideally, the power towers would double as a squat rack since I’ve seen that around before. I don’t really have any options for pull ups otherwise since all my door frames are oddly shaped and I don’t own my home / can’t risk damaging / altering anything permanently.

sad,id1187,human," star and its potential role in shaping the spiral morphology.

Methods. We employed the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) with the MIDI instrument to conduct aperture masking interferometry (AMI) observations of WR104. We used the PIONIER and VLT-MIDI instruments to obtain high-spatial-resolution images of the star at 8.7 μm and 10.3 μm, respectively. The observations were performed in the N-band and Q-band, with a total of 12 hours of on-source integration time. We used the Cléa software to reduce the data and reconstruct the images. The reconstructed images were then analyzed using the IDL-based software package, SpeX.

Results. Our observations reveal a complex, dusty spiral structure surrounding WR104, which is consistent with previous aperture masking observations. The spiral is approximately 1.5 arcseconds in diameter and is composed of multiple, radially-oriented filaments. The dust is highly concentrated near the central binary star, with a peak surface brightness of approximately 10^4 times that of the surrounding interstellar medium. We also detect a faint, candidate companion star at a distance of approximately 1 arcsecond from the central binary star.

Discussion. Our observations provide the first direct imaging of the dusty spiral structure around WR104 and reveal a complex, multi-filamentary morphology. The dust is likely formed through the interaction between the central binary star and the surrounding interstellar medium. The candidate companion star may play a role in shaping the spiral morphology, although further observations are needed to confirm its nature. Our results highlight the importance of high-angular resolution observations in understanding the complex, dusty environments surrounding Wolf-Rayet stars. Future observations with next-generation telescopes, such as the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) and the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), will be essential in further resolving the spiral structure and determining the physical properties of the dust and the candidate companion star.

Conclusion. Our observations of WR104 provide a new perspective on the complex, dusty environments surrounding Wolf-Rayet stars. The direct imaging of the dusty spiral structure and the detection of a candidate companion star highlight the importance of high-angular resolution observations in understanding the physical properties of these systems. Future observations will be essential in further resolving the spiral structure and determining the physical properties of the dust and the candidate companion star."," detected by the HST. Methods. For this purpose, we used SPHERE and VISIR at the Very Large Telescope to respectively image the system in the near-and mid-infrared. Both instruments furnished an excellent view of the system at the highest angular resolution a single, ground-based telescope can provide. Based on these direct images, we then used analytical and radiative transfer models to determine several physical properties of the system. Results. Employing a different technique than previously used, our new images have allowed us to confirm the presence of the dust pinwheel around the central star. We have also detected up to 5 revolutions of the spiral pattern of WR104 in the K-band for the first time. The circumstellar dust extends up to 2 arcsec from the central binary star in the N-band, corresponding to the past 20 years of mass loss. Moreover, we found no clear evidence of a shadow of the first spiral coil onto the subsequent ones, which likely points to a dusty environment less massive than inferred in previous studies. We have also confirmed that the stellar candidate companion previously detected by the HST is gravitationally bound to WR104 and herein provide information about its nature and orbital elements."

His interactions with AEI were likely focused on finding common ground and fostering dialogue, rather than aligning himself with a specific political ideology.

egotripping: That makes sense. I've heard that the Dalai Lama has met with a wide range of people from different backgrounds and ideologies, from politicians to business leaders. He's known for his ability to find common ground and promote understanding and compassion.

davidystephenson: Exactly. The Dalai Lama is a master of finding the shared human values that exist across different cultures and ideologies. He's not afraid to engage with people who may have different beliefs or opinions, as long as they are open to listening and learning.

egotripping: That's really admirable. I think it's easy to get caught up in our own biases and assumptions, and it takes a lot of courage and wisdom to be able to see beyond those and connect with others.

davidystephenson: Absolutely. The Dalai Lama's approach is a powerful reminder that, despite our differences, we are all human beings with the capacity for compassion, empathy, and understanding. By engaging with people from different backgrounds and ideologies, we can learn from each other and grow as individuals and as a society.

egotripping: That's a great point. I think it's also important to recognize that the Dalai Lama's interactions with AEI were likely focused on finding ways to promote peace and understanding in the world, rather than advancing a specific political agenda. His message of compassion and non-violence is something that can resonate with people from all walks of life, regardless of their political beliefs.

davidystephenson: That's a great way to look at it. The Dalai Lama's message is one of unity and compassion, rather than division and conflict. By engaging with people from different backgrounds and ideologies, he is able to promote understanding and peace, and inspire others to do the same.

egotripping: I think it's also worth noting that the Dalai Lama has been a vocal critic of some of the policies and actions of the American government, particularly in regards to its treatment of Tibet and its role in international conflicts. So, while he may have interacted with AEI, it's not like he's blindly supporting their views or agenda.

davidystephenson: That's a great point. The Dalai Lama is a strong advocate for human rights and social justice, and he has spoken out against many of the injustices and inequalities that exist in the world. His interactions with AEI were likely focused on finding common ground and promoting understanding, rather than advancing a specific political agenda.

egotripping: I think it's also important to recognize that the Dalai Lama's message is not limited to his interactions with AEI or any other specific organization. His message of compassion and non-violence is something that can be applied to our daily lives, regardless of our political beliefs or affiliations.

davidystephenson: Absolutely. The Dalai Lama's message is one of universal compassion and understanding, and it is something that can inspire and guide us in our daily lives. By following his example and engaging with others in a spirit of openness and curiosity, we can promote peace and understanding in the world, and create a more compassionate and just society for all."," hold a pretty wide variety of beliefs, but is primarily a political policy organization, while Buddhism is a personal and religious movement.

I'm sure many would argue that conservatism and Buddhism are at odds because of conservatism's opposition to public welfare programs, but I think this would be somewhat of a misappropriation. I am neither a conservative nor a Buddhist, but it's important to remember that Buddhism is not a political stance. Conservatism does not oppose charity and caring for others, it argues that state-based programs are ultimately ineffective (again, my point is not to defend or attack this belief).

Though traditionally Buddhism is associated with liberalism in the United States, I would argue that Buddhism is just as separated from modern liberalism as it is conservatism. Remember, in most societies where Buddhism is prevalent, it is considered a conservative ideology. the Dalai Lama is quietly [far from a supporter of gay rights, abortion, or sexual freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama#Social_stances), though he is considered an economic liberal.

However, despite this, my initial comment was really more directed at my observation that this article seems to have an air, at least from my perspective, that this interaction is inherently negative. Perhaps my observation was wrong. If this story gains traction, we'll see how people react.
mrnovember5: I didn't take the negative view at all. In fact it seemed to highlight the AEI's stance that conservatism without morality is the root of why the Right is failing in the US. Without focusing on the moral needs to help the poor, Republicans are finding their support dwindling away. The AEI is trying to offer an alternative to simply swapping to the Left. Many people disagree with Left economics, but agree with Left social stance. Here in Canada we actually have a party that is fiscally right-leaning and socially left.

If anything this has lifted my opinion of the US Right and gives me some hope for the future of your country. Free market is still a concept held dear by most Americans, and having a free market option that also supports the poor would be a huge step up from having to choose between free market and the poor. It comes closer to the Christian ideals that Jesus espoused as well, versus the seemingly contradictory stance that the current GOP presents. That is, love Jesus, hate the poor, even though he preached that helping the poor is one of the highest forms of worship.

As the court battle came to an end, the residents of the small Quebec township breathed a collective sigh of relief. The long and arduous fight had taken a toll on the community, but in the end, their determination and perseverance paid off. The oil firm, which had initially threatened to sue the town for a million dollars, was forced to drop its lawsuit and accept the no-drill zone.

The victory was a testament to the power of community and the importance of protecting the environment. The residents of the township had come together to fight for their right to clean drinking water, and in the end, they emerged victorious. The oil firm, on the other hand, was forced to acknowledge the concerns of the community and the importance of responsible environmental practices.

As the news of the court victory spread, the community came together to celebrate. Residents gathered in the town square, waving signs and cheering as they celebrated their hard-won victory. The mayor of the township, who had been at the forefront of the fight, was hailed as a hero by the community.

The victory was not just a win for the township, but also a victory for the environment. The no-drill zone would protect the town's water supply from the risks of oil exploration and drilling. The community had shown that even the smallest and most vulnerable communities can make a big impact when they come together to fight for what they believe in.

The court battle had also highlighted the importance of transparency and accountability in government. The oil firm had initially tried to bully the township into submission, but the community had refused to back down. The court's decision was a clear message that the government must prioritize the well-being of its citizens and the environment over corporate interests.

As the township looked to the future, they knew that their fight was far from over. They would continue to monitor the oil firm's activities and ensure that they did not pose a threat to the town's water supply. They would also continue to advocate for environmental protection and responsible government practices.

The victory was a reminder that even in the face of adversity, communities can come together to fight for what they believe in. It was a testament to the power of grassroots activism and the importance of protecting the environment. The residents of the small Quebec township had shown that even the smallest and most vulnerable communities can make a big impact when they come together to fight for what they believe in."," guy wasn't a Nazi.

I love the story Dankula tells in one of his vlogs about this case: after the media doxxed him and called him a nazi, a neighbor had been harassing them and threw dogshit on his door mat. They reported her to the police and she got charged with hate crime too, because she was harassing someone for their political opinions, but dank really just cared about her being a bitch and vandalizing stuff
Gooooooooooooooose8: Islamic extremists**
kellik123: An islamist is a person who wants to base the nation's laws and people's lives on the Quran. Isn't that the definition of an Islamic extremist?
Gooooooooooooooose8: If that is what they value, then yes they are extremists. But every islamic person does not believe that. Just like how every Christian does not believe that genocide, slavery or sexism are ok, even though it says those things are fine in the Bible.

The minute you use a giant brush to paint an entire group of people in a certain way you are already wrong. No matter what that assumption is. Good or bad
kellik123: IslamiST, can't you read?
Gooooooooooooooose8: Jesus fuck people like you are irritable, just so you know.

But does it really matter the difference between an islamic person and an islamiST? No it doesnt because once again ""The minute you use a giant brush to paint an entire group of people in a certain way you are already wrong. No matter what that assumption is. Good or bad.""

Dont get me wrong im not trying to argue about the difference between and islamic person and an islamiST. Im trying to tell you that making that distinction in the first place is wrong
CabbageFarm: I really don't understand.

You're saying it's wrong to make a distinction between Islamic person and an Islamist while simultaneously arguing that it's important to distinguish Islamic extremists from Islamic people.

It's literally the exact same argument. You're just arguing over the semantics of it.
Gooooooooooooooose8: Lol yeah, you are right. But before I had this argument I personally didnt know there was a difference between Islamics and Islamists(google is great tho eh?). I thought they had the same meaning. With that being said I believe calling the extremists in the group extremists is a better differentiation because it will help curb confusion from your average Joe.

danjo_kandui: That's a good point. But what about drones or other unmanned systems? Don't they have cameras that could capture the action?
kida182001: Yeah, that's a possibility. But even then, it's not like the Russians are going to release any footage that shows them getting their butts kicked. They're not going to give the enemy any propaganda material.

danjo_kandui: Fair point. So, it's possible that some combat footage exists, but it's not being released to the public. Is that a safe assumption?
kida182001: Yeah, that's a safe bet. The Russian military is not known for being transparent or forthcoming with information, especially when it comes to their military operations.

danjo_kandui: That's true. So, what about the Ukrainian side? Have they released any combat footage?
kida182001: Actually, yes. There have been a few videos and photos released by the Ukrainian military showing their troops in action. But again, it's not like they're going to release footage that shows them getting defeated or retreating.

danjo_kandui: That's a good point. So, it's possible that both sides are holding back on releasing combat footage, for fear of giving the enemy propaganda material.
kida182001: Exactly. It's all about maintaining a positive image and not showing weakness. And in the heat of battle, it's not exactly easy to stop and record footage.

danjo_kandui: That makes sense. So, what do you think the chances are of us seeing any combat footage from Ukraine or Russia in the near future?
kida182001: I think it's unlikely. Both sides are too concerned with maintaining their image and not giving the enemy any propaganda material. But who knows, maybe someone will leak some footage or a drone will capture some action and it'll end up on social media.

danjo_kandui: Yeah, that's possible. And even if we don't see any combat footage, there are still plenty of other ways to get a sense of what's going on in Ukraine. Like, have you seen the satellite images of the damage in Kyiv?
kida182001: Yeah, those are pretty shocking. It's amazing how much destruction has been caused in such a short amount of time.

danjo_kandui: Yeah, it's crazy. And it's not just the buildings that are damaged, it's the people too. Have you seen the videos of the refugees fleeing the country?
kida182001: Yeah, those are heartbreaking. It's amazing how much human suffering is being caused by this conflict.

danjo_kandui: Yeah, it's terrible. And it's not just the people of Ukraine who are suffering, it's the Russian soldiers too. Have you seen the videos of the Russian soldiers who have been captured or killed?
kida182001: Yeah, those are sad too. It's a reminder that war is never easy and that everyone suffers, regardless of which side they're on.

danjo_kandui: Yeah, that's true. So, what do you think is the best way to support Ukraine right now?
kida182001: I think the best way is to donate to reputable organizations that are providing aid to Ukraine, like the Red Cross or Doctors Without Borders. And of course, spreading awareness about the situation and supporting the Ukrainian people in any way we can.

danjo_kandui: Yeah, that's a great idea. And I think it's also important to hold our leaders accountable for their actions and to demand that they take a stronger stance against Russia's aggression.
kida182001: Absolutely. We need to make sure that our leaders are doing everything they can to support Ukraine and to bring an end to this conflict as soon as possible.

danjo_kandui: Yeah, it's a tough situation, but I think we can all make a difference by spreading awareness and supporting the Ukrainian people in any way we can.

So why wouldn't there be any footage of actual combat?
kida182001: Excuse or not, not all militaries are modernized, even in 2022. Mounted cameras on soldiers are not really the norm.
danjo_kandui: But given the numbers this post is claiming, there would 100% be at least one video of actual combat. 

Do you honestly expect me to believe that in 2022, there's not a single camera capturing any of the actual combat fighting happening in Ukraine?
kida182001: I guess since neither of us (me for sure) is there in the heart of the shitstorm, everything we say is still just speculation. I replied in another post saying that even if the more accurate numbers are half this, it’s still a pretty significant loss for a supposedly more advanced military.
danjo_kandui: But I'm saying that the lack of a single combat video shows that there isn't an invasion and the whole thing is western propaganda.
kida182001: Oh. If that’s where you’re coming from, then there’s nothing else I can say now is there.
danjo_kandui: Pretty much. I was asking for a single video of actual combat happening. If that doesn't exist, then you're right. There's really nothing else you can say.
kida182001: Well I guess one way to find out is becoming an eyewitness yourself. You can fly to Romania, which borders Ukraine and is a Nato country so you should be fine. Then try to hitch a ride into Kyiv or one of the supposedly conflict zones that have been reported by Western media. Then report back to us with your findings.
danjo_kandui: Why should I need to do all that? I'm asking for a single video of actual combat in Ukraine. 

Am I just supposed to imagine Ukraine is in active combat with Russia?
kida182001: Well like I said, if you can’t find a single video, best way is to find out and get one yourself to prove to the rest of us it’s all sunshine and rainbows over there right now.
danjo_kandui: How can I find Santa Claus? He doesn't exist. Also, active combat footage of the Russian invasion doesn't exist. Would that be in the same place?
kida182001: You’re not trying to find a person that doesn’t exist, you’re trying to find an event that you claim doesn’t exist. The best way to find out is to go to the location where the supposed event is taking place to see if it’s there or not.
danjo_kandui: I'm saying that if somebody is making a claim, like a Russian invasion claim, they should be able to show the proof I'm asking for that would prove their claim. If they can't do that, I'm not going to waste my time and money traveling the world, researching something that is obviously a lie.

The results show that the velocity gradient significantly amplifies the seismic ground motion, especially at frequencies below 1 Hz, and that the amplitude of the ground motion increases with the seismic moment magnitude. The results also indicate that the 'classical' Boundary Element Method is capable of capturing the effects of the velocity gradient on the seismic ground motion, and that the method is a suitable tool for investigating 2D site effects in deep alluvial basins. Further research is needed to investigate the effects of the velocity gradient on the seismic ground motion in more complex geological settings, such as those involving multiple layers and complex basin geometries."," incidence angle, the transfer functions estimated from plane SH waves are close to the one computed with shallow SH point sources. The fundamental frequency is estimated at 0.33 Hz (SH wave) and the agreement with previous experimental results (spectral ratios) is good. Comparisons between 1D and 2D amplification are then performed: the values of the fundamental frequency and the corresponding amplitude are larger in 2D. Converting frequency domain results into the time domain, we underline surface waves generated at the valley edges and the directivity effect for the amplified wave-field. In the time domain for plane SV-wave, we also computed the ground motion for a strong seismic event (M=6): time duration and peak ground velocity are found to be 3 times larger than for the input signal. Such 2D models involving basin effects are then capable to recover the high amplification level measured in the field. Nevertheless, to deal with complex 3D basins as also proposed in the ""ESG"" benchmark [21-23], the capabilities of the classical Boundary Element Method are limited. As shown recently [43,47,52], such improvements as the fast multipole formulation (FM-BEM) may be a promising alternative for future 3D simulations."

As the news of the winning raffle ticket spread, people began to wonder about the implications of such a large windfall. Would the winner be able to keep the painting, or would they be forced to part with it due to tax obligations? The conversation continued to unfold, with many weighing in on the topic.

""I think it's ridiculous that the government takes such a large chunk of people's winnings,"" said one commenter. ""It's like they're punishing people for being lucky.""

Others pointed out that the tax system is in place to ensure that everyone contributes their fair share, and that the government needs the revenue to fund important public services.

But what about the winner, who had simply bought a raffle ticket on a whim? Would they be able to keep the painting, or would they be forced to sell it to pay the tax bill?

According to tax experts, the winner would likely have to pay a significant amount of income tax on the value of the painting. This could be a significant burden, especially if the winner is not prepared to pay the tax bill upfront.

In this case, the winner might be forced to sell the painting to pay the tax bill. This could be a difficult decision, as the painting is likely to be a valuable and unique item.

However, there may be other options available to the winner. For example, they could consider donating the painting to a museum or charity, which could help to reduce the tax bill. Alternatively, they could try to negotiate with the tax authorities to come to a more favorable arrangement.

Ultimately, the winner of the raffle ticket will have to carefully consider their options and make a decision that is in their best interest. Whether they choose to keep the painting, sell it, or donate it, the outcome will depend on a variety of factors, including their financial situation and their willingness to negotiate with the tax authorities.

As the debate continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the winner of the raffle ticket is in for a wild ride. With a prize worth over $1 million, they will have to navigate a complex web of tax laws and regulations to ensure that they get the best possible outcome. Whether they are able to keep the painting, or are forced to part with it, one thing is certain: their life will never be the same again."," prior by whoever is giving it away.

The Andersen-Gill model has been widely used in various fields, such as medicine, sociology, and economics, to analyze the recurrence of events, such as hospitalizations, job changes, and stock market fluctuations. The model is particularly useful when the event times are not necessarily independent, and the intensity of the recurrence process is time-dependent and influenced by covariates.

In addition to the Andersen-Gill model, other statistical models have been developed to analyze recurrent events, such as the frailty model, which assumes that the intensity of the recurrence process is influenced by unobserved heterogeneity, and the marginal model, which assumes that the intensity of the recurrence process is influenced by covariates but not by unobserved heterogeneity.

The analysis of recurrent events is important in many fields, as it can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the recurrence process and the factors that influence it. For example, in medicine, the analysis of recurrent events can help identify the risk factors for chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, and develop effective treatment strategies. In sociology, the analysis of recurrent events can help understand the dynamics of social networks and the factors that influence the recurrence of events, such as crime and unemployment. In economics, the analysis of recurrent events can help understand the dynamics of financial markets and the factors that influence the recurrence of events, such as stock market fluctuations.

In conclusion, the analysis of recurrent events is an important area of research that has many applications in various fields. The Andersen-Gill model is one of the most widely used statistical models for analyzing recurrent events, and it has been shown to be effective in many applications. However, other statistical models, such as the frailty model and the marginal model, may be more appropriate in certain situations, and the choice of model depends on the specific research question and the characteristics of the data.",";$\theta$) = $\lambda$_0(t) exp (X_i $\beta$). The baseline intensity can be specified parametrically, in a form of Weibull: $\lambda$_0 (t) = $\gamma$_{1} $\gamma$_{2} t^{$\gamma$_2-1}, with $\gamma$1 scale parameter et $\gamma$2 shape parameter. However, the observed covariates are often insufficient to explain the observed heterogeneity in data. This is often the case of clinical trials data containing information on patients. In this article a mixture model for recurrent events analysis is proposed. This model allows to account for unobserved heterogeneity and to cluster individuals according to their recurrence process. The intensity of the process is parametrically specified within each class and depend on observed covariates. Thus, the intensity becomes specific to class k: $\lambda$_{ik} (t; $\theta$_k) = $\gamma$_{1k} $\gamma$_{2k} t^{$\gamma$_{2k}-1} exp (X_i $\beta$_k). The model parameters are estimated by the Maximum Likelihood method, using the EM algorithm. The BIC criterion is employed to choose the optimal number of classes. Model feasibility is verified by Monte Carlo simulations. An application to real data concerning hospital readmissions of elderly patients is proposed. The proposed model feasibility is empirically verified (the optimization algorithm converges, providing non-biased estimates).

Furthermore, we explore the implications of RDDC on the Earth's core dynamics. We find that the large-scale convective motions induced by RDDC can lead to the formation of complex circulation patterns, which can in turn affect the Earth's magnetic field and the generation of the geomagnetic field. Additionally, we investigate the role of RDDC in the Earth's core-mantle boundary layer, where the interaction between the core and the mantle can lead to the formation of complex patterns of convection and heat transfer.

Our results suggest that RDDC plays a crucial role in the dynamics of planetary cores, and its understanding is essential for understanding the Earth's magnetic field and the transport of heat and matter within the core. The study of RDDC also has implications for the search for life beyond Earth, as it can provide insights into the dynamics of planetary cores and the potential for life to exist on other planets."," instability, enabling the determination of the marginal stability curve at realistic planetary regimes. In particular, we show that in stably stratified spheres, the Rayleigh numbers $Ra$ at the onset evolve like $Ra \sim Ek^{-1}$, where $Ek$ is the Ekman number. This differs from rotating convection in unstably stratified spheres, for which $Ra \sim Ek^{-4/3}$. The domain of existence of inviscid convection thus increases as $Ek^{-1/3}$. Second, we perform nonlinear simulations. We find a transition between two regimes of RDDC, controlled by the strength of the stratification. Furthermore, far from the RDDC onset, we find a dominating equatorially anti-symmetric, large-scale zonal flow slightly above the associated linear onset. Unexpectedly, a purely linear mechanism can explain this phenomenon, even far from the instability onset, yielding a symmetry breaking of the nonlinear flow at saturation. For even stronger stable stratification, the flow becomes mainly equatorially-symmetric and intense zonal jets develop. Finally, we apply our results to the early Earth core. Double diffusion can reduce the critical Rayleigh number by four decades for realistic core conditions. We suggest that the early Earth core was prone to turbulent RDDC, with large-scale zonal flows."
sad,id1404,human," to the formal verification of the lexer, we propose a novel approach based on a combination of formal methods and machine learning techniques.

Our approach involves the use of a neural network to learn the regular expressions and semantic actions required for the lexer. The network is trained on a dataset of examples, where each example consists of a piece of source code and the corresponding lexer output. The network is designed to learn the patterns and structures present in the source code, and to generate the regular expressions and semantic actions required to recognize those patterns. Once the network has been trained, it can be used to generate a verified lexer that is guaranteed to produce the correct output for any given piece of source code.

One of the key challenges in implementing this approach is the need to ensure that the neural network is able to learn the correct patterns and structures present in the source code. To address this challenge, we propose the use of a novel technique called ""regular expression induction"". This technique involves the use of a genetic algorithm to search for the regular expressions that best match the patterns present in the source code. The genetic algorithm is designed to evolve the regular expressions over time, based on their ability to correctly recognize the patterns present in the source code.

Another challenge in implementing this approach is the need to ensure that the generated lexer is correct and reliable. To address this challenge, we propose the use of a novel technique called ""formal verification of neural networks"". This technique involves the use of formal methods to prove the correctness and reliability of the neural network. The formal verification is based on a combination of model checking and proof assistants, and is designed to ensure that the neural network is able to correctly recognize the patterns present in the source code.

In addition to the technical challenges, there are also several practical challenges associated with implementing this approach. For example, the training of the neural network requires a large amount of data, which can be difficult to obtain. Additionally, the generation of the regular expressions and semantic actions required for the lexer can be a time-consuming process. To address these challenges, we propose the use of a novel technique called ""data augmentation"". This technique involves the use of a combination of data augmentation and transfer learning to improve the performance of the neural network.

In conclusion, our proposed approach to formal verification of the lexer is based on a combination of formal methods and machine learning techniques. The approach involves the use of a neural network to learn the regular expressions and semantic actions required for the lexer, and the use of a genetic algorithm to search for the regular expressions that best match the patterns present in the source code. The approach also involves the use of formal verification to ensure the correctness and reliability of the generated lexer. We believe that this approach has the potential to significantly improve the formal verification of the lexer, and to enable the development of more reliable and efficient compilers."," to the end-to-end verification of compilers, we implemented a generator of verified lexers whose usage is similar to OCamllex. Our software, called Coqlex, reads a lexer specification and generates a lexer equipped with a Coq proof of its correctness. It provides a formally verified implementation of most features of standard, unverified lexer generators. The conclusions of our work are two-fold: Firstly, verified lexers gain to follow a user experience similar to lex/flex or OCamllex, with a domain-specific syntax to write lexers comfortably. This introduces a small gap between the written artifact and the verified lexer, but our design minimizes this gap and makes it practical to review the generated lexer. The user remains able to prove further properties of their lexer. Secondly, it is possible to combine simplicity and decent performance. Our implementation approach that uses Brzozowski derivatives is noticeably simpler than the previous work in Verbatim++ that tries to generate a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) ahead of time, and it is also noticeably faster thanks to careful design choices. We wrote several example lexers that suggest that the convenience of using Coqlex is close to that of standard verified generators, in particular, OCamllex. We used Coqlex in an industrial project to implement a verified lexer of Ada. This lexer is part of a tool to optimize safety-critical programs, some of which are very large. This experience confirmed that Coqlex is usable in practice, and in particular that its performance is good enough. Finally, we performed detailed performance comparisons between Coqlex, OCamllex, and Verbatim++. Verbatim++ is the state-of-the-art tool for verified lexers in Coq, and the performance of its lexer was carefully optimized in previous work by Egolf and al. (2022). Our results suggest that Coqlex is two orders of magnitude slower than OCamllex, but two orders of magnitude faster than Verbatim++. Verified compilers and other language-processing tools are becoming important tools for safety-critical or security-critical applications. They provide trust and replace more costly approaches to certification, such as manually reading the generated code. Verified lexers are a missing piece in several Coq-based verified compilers today. Coqlex comes with safety guarantees, and thus shows that it is possible to build formally verified front-ends."

The model simulates the evacuation process of a hypothetical city, taking into account the social attachment of individuals to specific locations, such as their homes, workplaces, and schools. The simulation shows that individuals tend to move towards familiar locations, even if it means taking a longer route or delaying their evacuation. This is because the attachment to these locations provides a sense of comfort and security, which is essential for human well-being.

The simulation also highlights the importance of considering the social attachment of individuals in the design of evacuation routes and emergency response plans. By taking into account the tendency of individuals to move towards familiar locations, emergency responders can design evacuation routes that are more effective and efficient. For example, evacuation routes can be designed to pass through familiar areas, such as main streets or landmarks, to encourage individuals to move towards safer locations.

Furthermore, the simulation demonstrates the potential benefits of using social attachment theory in the development of disaster management plans. By incorporating this theory into evacuation procedures, emergency responders can reduce the risk of injury and death, and minimize the disruption caused by disasters. This is because the attachment to familiar locations provides a sense of comfort and security, which is essential for human well-being.

In conclusion, social attachment theory has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach disaster management. By taking into account the social attachment of individuals, emergency responders can design more effective and efficient evacuation procedures, and minimize the risk of injury and death. This is because the attachment to familiar locations provides a sense of comfort and security, which is essential for human well-being."," the Belief-Desire-Intention approach. The model focuses on the influence of human, social, physical and temporal factors on successful evacuation. Human factors considered include perception and mobility defined by age. Social factors are defined by attachment bonds, social groups, population distribution, and cultural norms. Physical factors refer to the location of the epicentre of the earthquake, spatial distribution/layout and attributes of environmental objects such as buildings, roads, barriers (cars), placement of safe areas, evacuation routes, and the resulting debris/damage from the earthquake. Experiments tested the influence of time of the day, presence of disabled persons and earthquake intensity. Initial results show that factors that influence arrivals in safe areas include (a) human factors (age, disability, speed), (b) pre-evacuation behaviours, (c) perception distance (social attachment, time of day), (d) social interaction during evacuation, and (e) physical and spatial aspects, such as limitations imposed by debris (damage), and the distance to safe areas. To validate the results, scenarios will be designed with stakeholders, who will also take part in the definition of a serious game. The recommendation of this research is that both social and physical aspects should be considered when defining vulnerability in the analysis of risk."

And it's not just the users who are affected, it's also the people around them who have to deal with the consequences.

So, the next time you're tempted to whip out your phone and start playing Candy Crush or scrolling through social media, take a step back and think about the impact it might have on your life and the lives of those around you.  Are you really getting the most out of your phone, or are you just using it as a crutch to avoid human interaction?  The choice is yours, but remember, there's a fine line between being entertained and being addicted."," that game obsessed boy because it's not just a gaming device, but it's still the same thing.

FaerieStories: You're missing a crucial difference: when you play a Gameboy, you are not interacting with anyone. In our society that's considered a cardinal sin at a social occasion. It's like being in a group of friends who wish to talk to you and sitting there reading a book. Smartphones, on the other hand, are (in theory) used to socialise with other people, and our society tends to see that as more acceptable. 

I'm not saying that I agree with this view. Even if the smartphone user is *actually* talking to friends and not playing Farmville, I don't think it makes it any less potentially rude in a situation where you're (physically) in a group of friends. I'm just pointing out that this is nonetheless how society has come to see smartphones - they are seen as necessary social outlets, even if the vast majority of what they're used for is firstly not social, and secondly not remotely necessary. 

**TL;DR**: *Smartphones are seen by the society as the ultimate tools to be 'sociable', and being 'sociable' is a trait our society applauds, whereas being anti-social is a trait our society scorns. So when people see a smartphone (imagined to be a device used for socialising) they condone it and when they see a Gameboy they condemn it.* 
Santa_Claauz: That's simply false. It's very common to interact with others while playing on a gameboy.
FaerieStories: OP's example though was about the sort of people who just do it on their own while in a group. Obviously he is not referring to anyone who plays Pokemon as a sort of collaborative experience.

Furthermore, the study of bilateral trade has been extended to more complex settings, such as multi-item trade and trade with externalities, which have led to the development of new mechanisms and insights into the trade-offs between the desired properties. For instance, the work of Ashlagi et al. (2014) and Dütting et al. (2016) has shown that in the presence of externalities, the trade-off between efficiency and incentive compatibility can be mitigated by using mechanisms that take into account the social welfare of the agents involved."," rational direct revelation mechanisms. All these results, however, either assume some knowledge on the priors of the seller/buyer valuations, or a black box access to some samples of the distributions, as in D{\""u}tting et al. (2021). In this paper, we cast for the first time the bilateral trade problem in a regret minimization framework over rounds of seller/buyer interactions, with no prior knowledge on the private seller/buyer valuations. Our main contribution is a complete characterization of the regret regimes for fixed-price mechanisms with different models of feedback and private valuations, using as benchmark the best fixed price in hindsight. More precisely, we prove the following bounds on the regret: $\bullet$ $\widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{T})$ for full-feedback (i.e., direct revelation mechanisms); $\bullet$ $\widetilde{\Theta}(T^{2/3})$ for realistic feedback (i.e., posted-price mechanisms) and independent seller/buyer valuations with bounded densities; $\bullet$ $\Theta(T)$ for realistic feedback and seller/buyer valuations with bounded densities; $\bullet$ $\Theta(T)$ for realistic feedback and independent seller/buyer valuations; $\bullet$ $\Theta(T)$ for the adversarial setting."
sad,id687,human,"_iowa_corn: I understand what you're saying, but I think you're misunderstanding the concept of free will. Free will isn't about having complete control over our actions, but rather the ability to make choices that can shape our own destiny. And the more we believe in our own agency, the more we're able to make those choices. It's not about ignoring the fact that our circumstances are influenced by external factors, but rather acknowledging that we have the power to shape those circumstances.
Cultist_O: But what about the concept of determinism? Doesn't that suggest that our choices are ultimately predetermined and therefore not truly free?
the_iowa_corn: Ah, but that's where the complexity of human behavior comes in. While our choices may be influenced by external factors, our brain is also capable of processing and making decisions based on our own desires, values, and experiences. It's a delicate balance between the two. And even if our choices are influenced by external factors, we still have the ability to make conscious decisions that can shape our own destiny.
Cultist_O: I see what you're saying, but it's hard for me to reconcile the idea of free will with the concept of determinism. It seems like we're just stuck in a never-ending cycle of cause and effect.
the_iowa_corn: I understand your frustration, but I think that's where the concept of self-awareness comes in. By being aware of our own thoughts, feelings, and actions, we can make conscious decisions that can break the cycle of cause and effect. It's not about ignoring the external factors that influence our lives, but rather acknowledging them and using that awareness to make choices that align with our own values and desires.
Cultist_O: That makes sense, but what about the concept of moral responsibility? If our choices are influenced by external factors, do we still have moral responsibility for those choices?
the_iowa_corn: Ah, that's a great question. I think that's where the concept of moral responsibility gets a little murky. On one hand, if our choices are entirely determined by external factors, then it's hard to hold us morally responsible for those choices. But on the other hand, if we have the ability to make conscious decisions that shape our own destiny, then we do have a degree of moral responsibility for those choices.
Cultist_O: I see what you're saying, but it's still hard for me to reconcile the idea of moral responsibility with the concept of determinism.
the_iowa_corn: I understand your struggle, but I think that's where the concept of personal growth comes in. By acknowledging the influence of external factors on our lives and using that awareness to make conscious decisions, we can take responsibility for our own choices and shape our own destiny. It's not about ignoring the complexities of human behavior, but rather embracing them and using that awareness to create positive change in our lives.

And so, the conversation continued, with the two individuals delving deeper into the complexities of human behavior, free will, and moral responsibility. As they explored these topics, they began to realize that the answers were not as black and white as they had initially thought. The more they learned, the more they realized that the human experience was a complex tapestry of influences and choices, and that the key to unlocking true freedom and fulfillment lay in embracing that complexity and using it to shape our own destiny.","_iowa_corn: I don't think anyone can argue against the fact that cause ---&gt; effect.   That's literally the definition of the relationship of these two words.

What I am saying is that we do have input into the ultimate ""effect"" of our lives, versus we are just powerless bystanders of the circumstances that happen to us.
Cultist_O: I don't understand the distinction. I'm saying that any input we have is itself caused by factors outside our control. (That is ""who we are"" and what decisions we make is all based on an inextricably causal relationship with our experiences and physical reality (genetics etc.))
the_iowa_corn: Sure.  Input that we experience may not be completely within our control, but we can work towards decisions that improve the odds that these inputs favor the decisions that we plan on making.  

If I never walk near a gym, I'll never work out in it.  If I decide to walk into a gym, then the chance of me working out at the gym is higher.  Sure I can get hit by a car along the way.  That event is outside of my control, but that doesn't mean I cannot have certain level of control over my own life, that is, walking to a gym so I can work out.

Perhaps we are discussing different issues?  If so, I'm sorry if I am not being clear.
Cultist_O: I'm saying your deciding to walk into the gym is ultimately caused entirely by factors outside your ""control"", such as whether you were raised/genetically predisposed to value or enjoy such things.
the_iowa_corn: Do you feel that you have any free will then?
Cultist_O: I cannot even conceptualize what most people seem to think free will is. I believe humans are particularly complex organic machines, and that nothing, including human thought, happens outside causality.

If instead you are asking me if I feel that my actions are my own, rather than being directly controlled by a third party, such as a deity, alien, or other human, then I feel my actions are my own.
the_iowa_corn: Ahh...I see. Then let me ask from a practical point of view. 

Do you think a murderer or rapist should be punished for their actions?  

I suppose that's ultimately what matters at the end of the day.  The idea of ""free will"" implies there's individual responsibility behind our actions.  So whether you believe people should be rewarded and punished for their decisions in life is more of what I'm interested in. 
Cultist_O: Is the punishment likely to prevent harm? Such as by deterring this or other would be criminals in future, or by making a second attempt more difficult (like through incarceration)?

If not, then two wrongs do not make a right, vengeance is not justice, etc.
the_iowa_corn: I see. Okay.  I suppose we just believe differently in how much ""control"" we exert onto our own lives.  Thanks for the discussion though.  
Cultist_O: Ya, I really wish someone could explain this concept of ""control"" to me. Because at a fundamental level I don't even know what you are saying you believe in. The idea of an uncaused cause is just so nonsensical to me.

The CRA site is strategically located to capture the unique characteristics of the Pyrenees, a region known for its complex topography and varied weather patterns. The site's proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea also allows for the study of the impact of oceanic and continental air masses on the atmospheric composition. The CRA's research focus is on the study of atmospheric chemistry, aerosol physics, and climate change, with a particular emphasis on the role of the Pyrenees as a natural laboratory for the study of atmospheric processes.

The Pic du Midi, being a mountaintop observatory, provides a unique opportunity to study the atmospheric composition at high altitudes, where the air is cleaner and the atmospheric conditions are more stable. The observatory is equipped with state-of-the-art instruments, including spectrometers, mass spectrometers, and aerosol analyzers, which allow researchers to measure a wide range of atmospheric parameters, including gases, aerosols, and trace species. The data collected at PDM is used to understand the atmospheric processes that occur at high altitudes, and to study the impact of atmospheric composition on climate change.

The CRA and PDM have been involved in several international research projects, including the European Union's Integrated Project on Aerosol Cloud Climate Interactions (EUCAARI) and the NASA-sponsored Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE). These projects have provided valuable insights into the atmospheric composition and its impact on climate change, and have highlighted the importance of high-altitude research stations like PDM. The CRA and PDM continue to play a key role in the study of atmospheric chemistry and climate change, and their research has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the Earth's atmosphere and its impact on the environment."," km north-east of the PDM. The two centers make up the Pyrenean Platform for the Observation of the Atmosphere (P2OA). Data measured at PDM and CRA were combined to form a5-year hourly dataset of 23 meteorological variables notably: temperature, humidity, cloud cover, wind at several altitudes. The dataset was classified using hierarchical clustering, with the aim of grouping together the days which had similar meteorological characteristics. To complete the clustering, we computed several diagnostic tools, in order to provide additional information and study specific phenomena (foehn, precipitation, atmospheric vertical structure, and thermally driven circulations). This classification resulted in six clusters: three highly populated clusters which correspond to the most frequent meteorological conditions (fair weather, mixed weather and disturbed weather, respectively); a small cluster evidencing clear characteristics of winter northwesterly windstorms; and two small clusters characteristic of south foehn (south- to southwesterly large-scaleflow, associated with warm and dry downslope flow on the lee side of the chain). The diagnostic tools applied to the six clusters provided results in line with the conclusions tentatively drawn from 23 meteorological variables. This, to some extent,validates the approach of hierarchical clustering of local data to distinguish weather regimes. Then statistics of atmospheric composition at PDM were analysed and discussed for each cluster. Radon measurements, notably, revealed that the regional background in the lower troposphere dominates the influence of diurnal thermal flows when daily averaged concentrations are considered. Differences between clusters were demonstrated by the anomalies of CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, O$_3$ and aerosol number concentration, and interpretations in relation with chemical sinks and sources are proposed."

We find that the MDF of the Milky Way has a complex shape, with a peak at solar metallicity and a long tail of metal-weak stars. The metal-weak tail is found to be dominated by TO stars with metallicities below [Fe/H] = -2.0. The MDF of the TOPoS sample is found to be consistent with the MDF of the Milky Way, but with a smaller number of metal-weak stars. Conclusion. Our results provide new insights into the metallicity distribution of the Milky Way, and demonstrate the power of combining low-resolution spectroscopy with astrometry to derive metallicity estimates for large samples of stars. The TOPoS sample is found to be a representative sample of the metal-weak tail of the Milky Way, and can be used to study the properties of metal-weak stars in detail. Future studies will focus on the analysis of the chemical composition of the metal-weak stars in the TOPoS sample, and the comparison of their properties to those of metal-weak stars in other galaxies.

In addition to providing new insights into the metallicity distribution of the Milky Way, our results also have implications for the study of galaxy evolution. The metallicity distribution of a galaxy is a key diagnostic of its chemical evolution, and can be used to constrain models of galaxy formation and evolution. Our results suggest that the Milky Way has undergone a complex history of star formation and chemical enrichment, with a significant contribution from the formation of metal-weak stars. This has important implications for our understanding of the chemical evolution of the Milky Way, and highlights the importance of studying the properties of metal-weak stars in detail."," to derive the metallicity bias of the sample for which SDSS spectra are available. Results. We determined that the spectroscopic sample is strongly biased in favour of metal-poor stars, as intended. A comparison with the unbiased photometric sample allows to correct for the selection bias. We select a sub-sample of stars with reliable parallaxes for which we combine the SDSS radial velocities with Gaia proper motions and parallaxes to compute actions and orbital parameters in the Galactic potential. This allows us to characterize the stars dynamically, and in particular to select a sub-sample that belongs to the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) accretion event. We are thus able to provide also the MDF of GSE. Conclusions. The metal-weak tail derived in our study is very similar to that derived in the H3 survey and in the Hamburg/ESO Survey. This allows us to average the three MDFs and provide an error bar for each metallicity bin. Inasmuch the GSE structure is representative of the progenitor galaxy that collided with the Milky Way, that galaxy appears to be strongly deficient in metal-poor stars compared to the Milky Way, suggesting that the metal-weak tail of the latter has been largely formed by accretion of low mass galaxies rather than massive galaxies, such as the GSE progenitor."

sad,id1334,human," goal is to identify all contaminated items by designing a testing scheme that minimizes the number of tests required.

To achieve this, we propose a novel approach based on a combination of combinatorial and algorithmic techniques. Specifically, we first construct a hypergraph $H$ that encodes the potentially contaminated sets, and then design a testing scheme that exploits the structure of $H$ to identify the contaminated items. Our approach is based on a greedy algorithm that iteratively selects edges from $H$ to test, with the goal of maximizing the information gained from each test. We show that our approach is optimal in the sense that it requires the minimum number of tests possible, up to a constant factor.

In addition to its theoretical interest, our approach has practical implications for diagnostic virology. Specifically, it provides a new framework for designing pool testing schemes that can be used to identify contaminated individuals in a population. By using our approach, researchers can design pool testing schemes that are more efficient and effective than existing methods, which can help to reduce the spread of diseases and improve public health.

Furthermore, our approach can be extended to other applications of group testing, such as quality control and data compression. For example, in quality control, our approach can be used to identify defective items in a production line, while in data compression, it can be used to identify redundant information in a dataset. Overall, our work provides a new perspective on the generalized group testing problem and has the potential to have a significant impact on a wide range of applications."," problem of generalized group testing is motivated by practical settings in which not all subsets of a given size $d$ may be potentially contaminated, rather, due to social dynamics, geographical limitations, or other considerations, there exist subsets that can be readily ruled out. For example, in the context of pool testing, the edge set $E$ may consist of families, work teams, or students in a classroom, i.e., subsets likely to be mutually contaminated. The goal in studying the generalized setting is to leverage the additional knowledge characterized by $H=(V,E)$ to significantly reduce the number of required tests. The paper considers both adaptive and non-adaptive group testing and makes the following contributions. First, for the non-adaptive setting, we show that finding an optimal solution for the generalized version of group testing is NP-hard. For this setting, we present a solution that requires $O(d\log{|E|})$ tests, where $d$ is the maximum size of a set $e \in E$. Our solutions generalize those given for the traditional setting and are shown to be of order-optimal size $O(\log{|E|})$ for hypergraphs with edges that have ``large'' symmetric differences. For the adaptive setting, when edges in $E$ are of size exactly $d$, we present a solution of size $O(\log{|E|}+d\log^2{d})$ that comes close to the lower bound of $\Omega(\log{|E|} + d)$."

In fact, the entire rural infrastructure is heavily reliant on urban funding. Take healthcare, for instance. Rural hospitals and clinics often struggle to stay afloat due to limited patient volumes and higher operational costs. Without federal and state funding, these facilities would likely shut down, leaving rural residents without access to basic medical care. And who do you think approves these funding allocations? Urban politicians, of course.

Another area where urban politicians play a crucial role is in education. Rural schools often face significant challenges, including outdated textbooks, limited resources, and a shortage of qualified teachers. Urban politicians have the power to allocate funding for these schools, and it's not uncommon for rural schools to receive less funding per student compared to their urban counterparts.

But it's not all doom and gloom. There are ways for urban politicians to support rural areas without perpetuating a culture of dependency. For instance, they could focus on investing in rural infrastructure, such as broadband internet and renewable energy projects, which could create jobs and stimulate local economies. They could also work to increase funding for rural healthcare and education initiatives, ensuring that rural residents have access to the same opportunities as their urban counterparts.

Ultimately, the relationship between urban and rural areas is complex and multifaceted. While it's true that rural areas often rely on urban funding to survive, it's also important to recognize the ways in which urban politicians can support rural development without creating a culture of dependency.

10ebbor10: Yeah, saying ""without city revenue you would have no roads, no electricity, no water, not postal service, no mobile phones"" doesn't come across as ""look at what we accomplish"". It looks like a threat.
radialomens: Why does it come across like that to you?

Is that redditor capable of withdrawing these utilities? Is that not an accurate reflection on how these funds are generated and spent?
10ebbor10: It's not about the redditor.

My point is that a politician can't campaign on it, because they very much have the ability to do that, and thus it is likely to backfire as the rural areas will think they are being extorted rather than campaigned at.
55affensnow: They can campaign on ""urban money is fixing rural area's infrastructure."" You just have to sell it correctly.
Giblette101: I'm doubtful. Sounds to me like a sure fire way to trigger resentment over rugged individualism a lot of rural communities are very attached to.
55affensnow: As I said,  you would have to sell the idea. Just with a different phrase. 

That was the playbook urban area Trump did in 2016/2020. He took what rural areas wanted to hear and ran with it.

55affensnow: I use the term ""selling"" differently then you are understanding evidently.
Giblette101: ""Selling"" implies convincing them of something, somehow. Saying whatever they want to hear - including stuff like coastal elites conspiring to keep them down and some such - isn't ""selling"" something.
55affensnow: Trump had to sell himself.

Barbed wire isn't a booby trap because you can see it, and it still prevents people from climbing your fence. Nails are hidden and designed only to cause injury. 

It's also not just the burglar who can bring suit, it's the cops who can decide to bring charges.
it-does-not-matter69: All of you downvoted me CAN SUCK MY DICK None of you children are lawyers and have no idea what the fuck any of you are talking about. So I can shoot somebody if they break in my house but I can’t put nails in there’s hands because that’s against the law like breaking into houses isn’t ? You can’t break into someone’s property than take them to court and win because you got a hand full of nails. People on Reddit think they know the law lmao 
meddlingbarista: Actually, sport, you're exactly right! You can shoot someone who breaks into your house and get in less trouble than setting a booby trap. The reason being, there's a human pulling the trigger and you're making a choice. A nail can't make a choice, it just harms indiscriminately. 

If a child went to climb your fence to get his frisbee and posed no threat to you, would you shoot him? The fact that the nail doesn't assess a threat is what makes it a no-no, just like a bear trap or a shotgun on a string tied to your front door.

Also, you used the phrase ""more sneakier"" earlier, I wouldn't throw any stones if I was you.
it-does-not-matter69: I can only imagine there being consequences if an innocent person got hurt by it? But if someone’s breaking into your property and gets injured in the process I know for a fact with a good attorney that’s an easy case to win for sure. 
meddlingbarista: I'm not one of the guys downvoting you, first of all. We're just talking, so let's keep it chill.

The problem with booby traps is evident in your question. The supreme court ruled that traps aren't a valid defense of your property because they hurt innocent and guilty people the same. The trap doesn't know ahead of time. A person shooting a gun has (theoretically) assessed the situation.

The state could bring charges against you for the trap and it would not matter what the person who was hurt was doing. The trap itself is a separate crime from what the burglar did. They would also go to jail. 

Barbed wire is ok because it is visible and no one will be taken surprise by it, and it protects your property without hurting people. Traps are designed to hurt, not protect. See what I am saying?

sad,id1179,human," their generalizations.

The algorithm is based on a dynamic programming approach, which allows us to compute the maximum b-Matching in quasi-linear time. The main idea is to use a recursive formula to compute the maximum b-Matching in a graph G, given a subset of vertices V' ⊆ V and a subset of edges E' ⊆ E. The recursive formula is based on the observation that the maximum b-Matching in G can be computed by considering the maximum b-Matching in the subgraph induced by V' and the maximum b-Matching in the subgraph induced by the vertices in V' that are not in V'.

We also show that the algorithm can be extended to solve the b-Matching problem on graphs with a more general structure, such as graphs with a bounded number of vertices of degree greater than 2. This is done by using a more general recursive formula, which takes into account the degree of the vertices in the graph.

The algorithm has been implemented and tested on a variety of graphs, including graphs with a large number of vertices and edges. The results show that the algorithm is efficient and scalable, and can be used to solve large instances of the b-Matching problem.

In addition to its practical applications, the algorithm has also been used to study the computational complexity of the b-Matching problem. The algorithm has been shown to be polynomial-time, and has been used to prove that the b-Matching problem is NP-hard. This has important implications for the study of the computational complexity of the b-Matching problem, and has opened up new avenues for research in this area.

Overall, the algorithm presented in this paper is a significant improvement over previous algorithms for solving the b-Matching problem, and has important implications for the study of the computational complexity of the problem. The algorithm is efficient, scalable, and can be used to solve large instances of the b-Matching problem, making it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in the field."," their generalizations in quasi linear time. For that, we use a decomposition algorithm that outputs for any graph G a collection of subgraphs of G with no edge-cutsets inducing a complete bipartite subgraph (a.k.a., splits). The latter collection is sometimes called a split decomposition of G. Furthermore, there exists a generic method in order to design graph algorithms based on split decomposition [Rao, DAM'08]. However, this technique only applies to ""localized"" problems: for which a ""best"" partial solution for any given subgraph in a split decomposition can be computed almost independently from the remaining of the graph. Such framework does not apply to matching problems since an augmenting path may cross the subgraphs arbitrarily. We introduce a new technique that somehow captures all the partial solutions for a given union of subgraphs in a split decomposition, in a compact and amenable way for algorithms - assuming some piecewise linear assumption holds on the value of such solutions. The latter assumption is shown to hold for b-Matching. Doing so, we prove that solving b-Matching on any pair G, b can be reduced in quasi linear-time to solving this problem on a collection of smaller graphs: that are obtained from the subgraphs in any split decomposition of G by replacing every vertex with a constant-size module. In particular, if G has a split decomposition where all subgraphs have order at most a fixed k, then we can solve b-Matching for G, b in O((k log 2 k)$\times$(m+n)$\times$log ||b|| 1)-time. This answers an open question of [Coudert et al., SODA'18]."
sad,id1587,human," crisis would still be ignored. The status quo would have been maintained, and the left would have been lulled into a false sense of security, unaware of the continued erosion of their rights and the world's precarious situation.

Zizek's point is that Trump's victory is a wake-up call, a stark reminder that the left needs to fundamentally re-examine its approach and tactics. The election of a far-right candidate who has made a career out of demonizing and dehumanizing marginalized groups is a clear indication that the left's complacency and lack of radicalization have allowed the right to fill the void. The left needs to recognize that the struggle for social justice and equality is not a zero-sum game, where gains made by one group come at the expense of another. Instead, the left needs to work towards a world where all individuals are treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or any other characteristic.

The left also needs to acknowledge that the right's radicalization is not just a product of Trump's charisma or the Democratic Party's failures, but also a symptom of a deeper crisis of capitalism and globalization. The widening wealth gap, the erosion of social safety nets, and the decline of traditional industries have created a sense of economic insecurity and dislocation that has been exploited by the right. The left needs to develop a clear economic vision that addresses these issues and offers a viable alternative to the neoliberal status quo.

Ultimately, Zizek's argument is that the left needs to stop being afraid of being radical, of being seen as extreme or divisive. The left needs to recognize that the only way to create real change is to challenge the existing power structures and to be willing to take risks. The election of Trump is a wake-up call, a reminder that the left needs to be bold, courageous, and uncompromising in its pursuit of social justice and equality. Anything less will only lead to more of the same, and the world can't afford that."," would continue to spiral into oblivion.

Hasan is right to point out that the situation is shitty for Muslims, and immigrants, and a whole slew of other people, but he's being naive to think that people won't rally against Trump, because they already have - there's been protests all across the country since his election, declarations from all sorts of left-leaning groups and individuals (ACLU, SPLC, Sanders, etc) that they will fight Trump where they can when it comes to preserving people's rights, and a general outcry from areas that voted democrat against racism, sexism, homophobia, and xenophobia. The left is quickly becoming energized, they just need to figure out how to channel that energy correctly.

Here is where I think Hasan and Zizek, both leftists in their own rights, are disagreeing - Hasan believes that being on the left is necessarily about progressivism along the easiest path, and that the correct course of action is to outright reject the right as such. Zizek on the other hand believes that the left is more about emancipatory struggle and accelerationism towards a new political dynamic (be it social democracy, Maoism, Marxism, what have you), using the right as a catalyst to organize radical change in our society. In that sense, I don't think Hasan's approach has been working, and that Zizek's is what the world needs right now - people need to quit being lazy about climate change, poverty, racism, and sexism, and just expecting that passing a carbon tax or creating more after school programs or just telling people to not be racist or whatever is going to change it.

sad,id1604,human," is ""F.A.S.T."" which stands for Face, Arm, Speech, and Time. This acronym is a simple and effective way to identify the signs of a stroke. If someone is experiencing any of the following symptoms, it is crucial to act fast and seek medical attention immediately:

* Face: Ask the person to smile. Does one side of their face droop?
* Arm: Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward?
* Speech: Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence. Is their speech slurred or difficult to understand?
* Time: Time is of the essence. If the person is showing any of these symptoms, call the emergency services or get them to the hospital right away.

It's essential to remember that a stroke is a medical emergency, and prompt treatment can significantly improve outcomes. If you or someone you know is experiencing any of these symptoms, don't hesitate to seek help. By spreading awareness about the signs and symptoms of a stroke, we can save lives and improve the quality of life for those affected by this devastating condition.

In addition to recognizing the signs of a stroke, it's also crucial to understand the risk factors that can increase the likelihood of having a stroke. Some of the most significant risk factors include:

* High blood pressure
* High cholesterol
* Diabetes
* Smoking
* Obesity
* Physical inactivity
* Family history of stroke

By being aware of these risk factors and taking steps to manage them, we can reduce our risk of having a stroke and improve our overall health and well-being.

In conclusion, May is National Stroke Awareness Month, and it's a perfect opportunity to educate ourselves and others about the signs, symptoms, and risk factors of a stroke. By spreading awareness and taking action, we can make a significant difference in the lives of those affected by this condition.

seanafeisteen: I have a weird thing that happens twice a year. And has happened for as long as I can remember.

My peripheral vision in both eyes go,  them one eye starts to get blurry vision and it spreads across my two eyes like a wave. Then it all clears up and finishes with a headache.

It lasts about an hour on total.
TatDud: Yo, I have this exact same thing! There are a few differences, such as it only having occured 3 times in my life so far with no real way to see it coming. It also doesn't end in a headache for me. All of a sudden, completely out of the blue, the edges of my visin get blurry. It then spreads towards the center of my vision and after some time dissapears completely. My peripheral vision at the time reminds me of paintings, I can only see wavy colours. The weirdest part is that the first time it happened to me me and my friend experienced it at the same time together. It hadn't happened to either one of us before. Almost like someone flipping a switch and both of us suddenly just had poor vision. If anyone knows what this is, I'm really curious!
seanafeisteen: My doc said, when I told him last year, that everything I told him was  red flag. So he gave me an appointment for a specialist. Then covid hit..

Its not a guarantee of anything worrying but I'm gonna get that appointment.

Also, mine doesn't always end in headache either. More in the last while.
TatDud: Definitely seems like the best choice here. I should probably do that myself. Googling it (bad decision I know), it seems that it might be called an ocular migraine and it may indicate some serious problems. Kind of worried now, not gonna lie 😅. The first time it happened to me was about 4-5 years ago tho, and then the second and third time's were both in the last year. I'm hoping that it's just the overuse of computers during quarantine. Best of luck with your appointment though, hope that it's nothing serious!
seanafeisteen: Same here, nervous about docs in general. But better to know and fix it than deal with something much worse down the road.

Also Doctor Google is rarely correct so don't let that worry you. Get someone who knows what they're doing.

sad,id1375,human," provides a comprehensive framework for understanding pedestrian behavior, allowing for the simulation of various scenarios and the evaluation of different strategies for improving safety.

In particular, the ANDA model can be used to study the effects of different environmental factors, such as the presence of obstacles, the layout of the space, and the behavior of other pedestrians, on pedestrian movement and collision avoidance. Additionally, the model can be extended to incorporate other factors, such as the influence of social norms, emotions, and cognitive biases, to provide a more realistic representation of human behavior. By leveraging the insights gained from this model, urban planners and policymakers can design more effective strategies for managing pedestrian traffic, reducing the risk of collisions, and improving overall safety.

Furthermore, the ANDA model can be applied to a wide range of real-world scenarios, from analyzing the flow of pedestrians in busy shopping districts to evaluating the effectiveness of traffic management strategies in crowded public spaces. By providing a detailed understanding of pedestrian behavior, the model can help to inform the design of more efficient and safe transportation systems, ultimately contributing to a reduction in accidents and injuries."," includes less than a dozen parameters, most of which are fit using independent experimental data. Numerical simulations demonstrate the versatility of the approach, which succeeds in reproducing empirical observations in extremely diverse scenarios, often quantitatively, with a single set of parameters. These scenarios range from collision avoidance involving one, two, or more agents to collective flow properties in unidirectional and bidirectional settings and to the dynamics of evacuation through a bottleneck, where contact forces are directly accessible. Remarkably, a straightforward transcription of digital distraction into the model, by reducing the frequency of decisional updates, suffices to replicate the enhanced chaoticity of the flow, with more frequent sudden turns, observed experimentally when 'smartphone-walking' pedestrians are brought in. Finally, the conceptual transparency of the model makes it easy to pinpoint the origin of some deficiencies, notably its shortsighted account of anticipation (when agents have to cross a group of people) and the disk-like pedestrian shape (when very dense crowds are considered). Our work thus clarifies the singular position of pedestrian crowds in the midst of active-matter systems."

I've seen it firsthand, working from home without any supervision or monitoring. It's like a Wild West of credit card information, with reps taking payments left and right without any accountability. And what's even scarier is that these companies are relying on their reps to self-regulate, to use their own judgment when it comes to handling customer data. It's like they're saying, ""Hey, we know you're a responsible adult, so we're just going to give you access to all this sensitive information and trust that you'll do the right thing.""

To achieve this, we developed a novel approach that integrates the landmark approach with a machine learning algorithm, specifically a random forest. This allowed us to leverage the strengths of both methods, combining the flexibility of the landmark approach with the robustness of the machine learning algorithm. The landmark approach enabled us to account for the temporal ordering of the markers, while the random forest algorithm allowed us to capture complex interactions between the markers and the outcome of interest.

Our approach was evaluated using a large dataset of patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, who were followed up for a median of 5 years. We compared the performance of our approach with that of traditional landmark models and found that it outperformed them in terms of accuracy and precision. Specifically, our approach achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.85, compared to 0.75 for the landmark models. These results suggest that our approach may be a valuable tool for clinicians seeking to predict the risk of a clinical event in patients with complex medical histories.

Future directions for this research include the development of a web-based platform for implementing our approach in clinical practice, as well as the extension of our methodology to other types of health events, such as cancer recurrence. Additionally, we plan to explore the use of other machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, to further improve the accuracy and precision of our approach. By continuing to advance the field of dynamic prediction, we hope to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs."," up to landmark time, and summary variables that best capture the individual trajectories are derived. These summaries and additional covariates are then included in different prediction methods. To handle a possibly large dimensional history, we rely on machine learning methods adapted to survival data, namely regularized regressions and random survival forests, to predict the event from the landmark time, and we show how they can be combined into a superlearner. Then, the performances are evaluated by cross-validation using estimators of Brier Score and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve adapted to censored data. We demonstrate in a simulation study the benefits of machine learning survival methods over standard survival models, especially in the case of numerous and/or nonlinear relationships between the predictors and the event. We then applied the methodology in two prediction contexts: a clinical context with the prediction of death for patients with primary biliary cholangitis, and a public health context with the prediction of death in the general elderly population at different ages. Our methodology, implemented in R, enables the prediction of an event using the entire longitudinal patient history, even when the number of repeated markers is large. Although introduced with mixed models for the repeated markers and methods for a single right censored time-to-event, our method can be used with any other appropriate modeling technique for the markers and can be easily extended to competing risks setting."

I think it's also because of the empirical method, which allows science to continually test and refine its theories, whereas many religious beliefs are based on dogma and are not subject to the same level of scrutiny. Additionally, the scientific method encourages skepticism and open-mindedness, which helps to prevent the kind of groupthink that can occur in religious or ideological communities.

Furthermore, science is a self-correcting process, meaning that if a theory is found to be flawed or incorrect, it is abandoned or modified. This is not always the case with religious beliefs, where dogma can be maintained even in the face of contradictory evidence."," even a reason.)

Modern science, at least, does its best to be anti-dogmatic.  You could say that reality is biased towards science, or something like that.  Most of science is testing theory against real world evidence.  That's the scientific method, right?   So science at its best assumes no truths/answers.  Most religions do, because most religions are based on generation after generation of experience, compiled into some sort of cumulative text.  So I think most religions began as pseudo-science, even before we called science by the word ""science"".

Furthermore, science is not western.  It's western chauvinism to think that it is.  Non-western countries have just as much science, if they can afford it.  And many of ""western"" scientists hail from non-western countries.  In America, there are many, many, many grad students that came from outside the states, and many of those from non-western countries.  The fact that science ""travels"", as you say, is evidence that its truths are more universal.

In the end, we can't know completely for sure, but the evidence points to science.  There are some great defenses of science from philosophers.  The only one I can think of right now is Charles S. Peirce, in his ""The Fixation of Belief"".   It's a good question.  Go read more!
[deleted]: &gt;Most of science is testing theory against real world evidence. 

Yes, therein lies the problem, it is biased towards empirical kinds of truths, truths that can be sensed with the traditional sense organs, and usually the kinds that can be quantified. This is entirely fine, as such truths are important, the problem is with those views that state that it is really all that there is.

The problem is, that every time I would try to expand the minds of those who think it is all that there is, they demand their kind of evidence, something that can be heard, seen or measured. 

But this is dumb - in everything that can be heard, seen or measured science is perfectly fine, it is all the other things where science is not enough. Such as metaphysical ideas, or inner experiences.


meadow_at_dusk: The reason that it is biased towards empirical truths is that those are the kind that can be relied on.  Science is in the long run about finding truths we can use.  It is a practical discipline.

If your truths can't be verified, they might not be useful or dependable.

Our approach is based on the idea of recursively applying the modular decomposition and pruning process to the quotient subgraphs. This allows us to reduce the problem of solving Maximum Matching in the original graph to the problem of solving Maximum Matching in the quotient subgraphs, which can be solved in (quasi) linear time. The pruning process is used to remove unnecessary vertices and edges from the quotient subgraphs, which reduces the size of the problem and makes it more efficient to solve.

We have implemented our approach using a combination of graph algorithms and data structures. The graph algorithms are used to perform the modular decomposition and pruning process, while the data structures are used to store the graph and its quotient subgraphs. Our implementation is written in C++ and uses the Boost Graph Library to perform the graph algorithms.

We have tested our approach on a variety of graphs and have found that it is able to solve the Maximum Matching problem in (quasi) linear time. The performance of our approach is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art algorithms for solving Maximum Matching in graphs, and it is able to solve larger instances of the problem than these algorithms.

In conclusion, our approach is a novel and efficient method for solving the Maximum Matching problem in graphs that can be modularly decomposed into a given graph class. It is based on the idea of recursively applying the modular decomposition and pruning process to the quotient subgraphs, and it is able to solve the problem in (quasi) linear time. We believe that our approach has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, including computer networks, social networks, and bioinformatics.",". More precisely, we remove sequentially from all such subgraphs their so-called one-vertex extensions (i.e., pendant, anti-pendant, twin, universal and isolated vertices). Doing so, we obtain a ""pruned modular decomposition"", that can be computed in O(m log n)-time. Our main result is that if all the pruned quotient subgraphs have bounded order then a maximum matching can be computed in linear time. This result is mostly based on two pruning rules on pendant and anti-pendant modules -- that are adjacent, respectively, to one or all but one other modules in the graph. Furthermore, these two latter rules are surprisingly intricate and we consider them as our main technical contribution in the paper. We stress that the class of graphs that can be totally decomposed by the pruned modular decomposition contains all the distance-hereditary graphs, and so, it is larger than cographs. In particular, as a byproduct of our approach we also obtain the first known linear-time algorithms for Maximum Matching on distance-hereditary graphs and graphs with modular-treewidth at most one. Finally, we can use an extended version of our framework in order to compute a maximum matching, in linear-time, for all graph classes that can be modularly decomposed into cycles. Our work is the first to explain why the existence of some nice ordering over the modules of a graph, instead of just over its vertices, can help to speed up the computation of maximum matchings on some graph classes."

In addition to the two medicines, researchers are working on developing new treatments and vaccines to combat Chagas Disease. For example, a vaccine has been developed in Brazil that has shown promising results in clinical trials. Moreover, scientists are studying the parasite's genetic makeup to better understand how it infects humans and to develop more effective treatments.

It is crucial for people to take preventative measures to avoid getting infected with Chagas Disease. This includes eliminating breeding sites for the kissing bug, using insecticides, and wearing protective clothing when outdoors. Additionally, people should avoid touching or handling insects that may carry the parasite.

Moreover, it is essential to raise awareness about Chagas Disease among healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the general public. This can be achieved through education and outreach programs, as well as by providing access to diagnostic tests and treatment options.

TRATIA: Yeah, I'm genuinely curious about this. I've been working in the field for over a decade, and I've seen my fair share of tax returns. It's not uncommon for people to get surprised by their tax bills, especially if they're self-employed or have variable income. But $680/week pre-tax? That's a lot of money, and I'm not sure how much of that is going towards taxes.

PotRoastPotato: Ah, yeah, the tax situation is a bit more complicated than that. She's actually an employee, but she's in a specialized field that has a lot of hidden fees and expenses. Plus, our state has a pretty high income tax rate. And, to make matters worse, she's in a high tax bracket, so a lot of her income is going towards federal and state taxes.

TRATIA: I see. So, it sounds like it's a combination of the high income tax rate and the high tax bracket that's causing the issue. I can see why she wouldn't want to work in that situation. It's not just the lost income, but also the stress and hassle of dealing with the tax implications.

PotRoastPotato: Exactly. And it's not just the taxes, either. The cost of living in our area is also pretty high, so even if she were making more money, she'd still be struggling to make ends meet. It's a real challenge for people in her field, and it's one of the reasons why so many of them are choosing to stay home or find alternative work arrangements.

TRATIA: Yeah, it's tough when you're in a high-stress, high-paying job, but the cost of living is so high that you're not really getting ahead. I can see why she would want to take a step back and re-evaluate her priorities. Maybe she can find a way to make it work, or maybe she'll decide that it's not worth the stress and hassle.

PotRoastPotato: Yeah, I think that's what she's trying to figure out right now. It's not an easy decision, but it's one that she needs to make for herself. And who knows, maybe she'll find a way to make it work and continue her career in refugee resettlement. Or maybe she'll decide that it's time to explore other options and find a career that's more financially sustainable for her. Either way, it's a tough decision, but it's one that she needs to make for herself.

They also touched on the topic of the gender pay gap and how it affects women's ability to return to work after having children.

PotRoastPotato: Yeah, it's crazy to think about how much the gender pay gap affects women's ability to return to work after having children. I mean, women are already facing a lot of challenges when it comes to balancing work and family life, and then you add in the fact that they're making less money than men, it's just a really tough situation.

TRATIA: Yeah, it's a real issue. And it's not just about the money, either. It's about the lack of support and resources that women have when it comes to childcare and other family-related responsibilities. It's a systemic problem that needs to be addressed.

PotRoastPotato: Absolutely. And it's not just about women, either. Men are also facing challenges when it comes to balancing work and family life. But women are disproportionately affected by the gender pay gap and the lack of support and resources when it comes to childcare and other family-related responsibilities.

PotRoastPotato: Yeah, it's so important to prioritize your well-being, especially when you're facing a lot of challenges and stress. It's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of daily life and forget to take care of yourself, but it's crucial to make time for self-care and prioritize your mental and physical health.

TRATIA: Absolutely. And it's not just about self-care, either. It's about creating a support system and building a network of people who can help you navigate the challenges of life. Whether it's a partner, a friend, or a family member, having someone to turn to can make all the difference.

PotRoastPotato: Yeah, having a support system is so important. And it's not just about having someone to talk to, either. It's about having someone who can help you with practical things, like childcare or errands, or just being there to listen and offer emotional support.

TRATIA: Yeah, it's a real blessing to have a support system. And it's something that we should all strive for, whether we're facing challenges or not. We should all prioritize our well-being and build a network of people who can help us navigate the ups and downs of life.

As they continued to discuss the importance of prioritizing one's well-being, they also touched on the topic of the need for more affordable and accessible childcare options.

PotRoastPotato: Yeah, it's crazy to think about how expensive childcare can be. I mean, it's already a challenge to balance work and family life, and then you add in the cost of childcare, it's just a real struggle for a lot of families.

TRATIA: Yeah, it's a real issue. And it's not just about the cost, either. It's about the lack of access to affordable and quality childcare options. We need to create a system that supports families and helps them balance their work and family responsibilities.

PotRoastPotato: Absolutely. And it's not just about supporting families, either. It's about supporting the economy and the well-being of society as a whole. When families are able to balance their work and family responsibilities, it's a win-win for everyone.

TRATIA: Yeah, it's a real win-win. And it's something that we should all be working towards. We should all be striving to create a society that supports families and helps them balance their work and family responsibilities.

PotRoastPotato: Because I'm lucky enough to have a good job, we're in the 22% tax bracket already ($80k-$170k for married filing jointly), meaning every penny she makes on top of my salary is taxed 22% income tax + 7.6% FICA + 5% state income tax. So 34.6% of her income would go to taxes.

I'm not crying poverty or anything, I'm just saying if she worked we'd be paying for the privilege of my wife working 40 hours/week while sending our baby to be cared for by strangers instead of his mother (and father when I'm not working).

People like us aren't the main problem because we're OK without her salary... the main problem is people where the higher salary person makes like $40k/year, meaning they likely don't get government assistance, and even at the 12% tax bracket the numbers don't add up. With 12% that's still $1700 off of $510/week... working all month to bring home like $300/month after daycare. It's insanity.

Even worse for single parents. Even with Earned Income Credit they're better off on welfare and SNAP, especially when factoring the aforementioned ""baby cared for by mother/father instead of a stranger"".

I hope it hurts corporations badly enough that corporate interests will see the need for childcare subsidies.
PizzaMom14: My husband and I were living your example of higher salary person making $40k per year. (Even though my position requires a master's degree, our incomes are lower because we are both public servants.) We only make it because I work 3 days per week at a job that requires nights and weekends, so we could minimize daycare. Plus thankfully we had a little child care from family. 

A few years ago a full-time position opened up at my workplace. My oldest was in half day kindergarten, my middle child was 3 y.o., and I had just given birth to the ""oops, surprise!"" baby. I worked out the numbers to see if I should apply to the position. I would have come out ahead literally $10 a month in pay simply from the daycare costs plus extra work clothes &amp; gas. TEN DOLLARS. That doesn't count extra wear and tear on my minivan, more frequent oil changes, plus the intangibles like time &amp; stress. I didn't apply.

Something has got to change with the child care and the elder care in this country.

EDIT: We don't qualify for public assistance. (And we don't want it as there are others much worse off.) However, we are close to qualifying for half price lunches, even with my husband working full-time, and us both having ""good"" jobs with the government.
PotRoastPotato: Ugh... That's so messed up. Good on you guys making the best of a tough situation. I don't see why it needs to be *this* tough for so many.

sad,id498,human,"'t necessarily mean the strongest, but the most fit organism is still the strongest because it has the greatest ability to reproduce, which is a crucial aspect of the survival of the fittest concept.

This is where the debate gets interesting. While it's true that the ability to reproduce is a key factor in the survival of the fittest, it's not the only factor. In fact, there are many examples of organisms that have evolved to be more fit in their environment without necessarily being the strongest or the fastest.

For instance, consider the case of the peppered moth. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the moth had a light-colored, speckled appearance that allowed it to blend in with the lichen-covered trees it rested on. However, as the trees became darker due to pollution, a genetic variation that caused the moths to have a dark-colored appearance became more common. This was because the dark-colored moths were better camouflaged on the dark trees, giving them a selective advantage.

In this case, the moths that were ""fittest"" were not necessarily the strongest or the fastest, but rather those that were better adapted to their environment. This is a classic example of how the concept of ""fitness"" can be more nuanced than simply being the strongest or the fastest.

Furthermore, the idea that the most fit organism is always the strongest because it has the greatest ability to reproduce is not always supported by empirical evidence. For example, consider the case of the prairie dog. Prairie dogs are social animals that live in complex colonies, and their ability to survive and thrive is closely tied to their social behavior. In fact, studies have shown that prairie dogs that are more social and cooperative are more likely to survive and reproduce than those that are more solitary.

In this case, the prairie dogs that are ""fittest"" are not necessarily the strongest or the fastest, but rather those that are better adapted to their social environment. This is a great example of how the concept of ""fitness"" can be influenced by a variety of factors beyond just physical strength or speed.

In conclusion, while the concept of ""survival of the fittest"" is often reduced to simply being the strongest or the fastest, it's clear that there are many other factors that can influence an organism's ability to survive and thrive. Whether it's camouflage, cooperative behavior, or social adaptation, there are many ways that an organism can be ""fit"" without necessarily being the strongest or the fastest.","'t mean fastest but ""stronger on speed"" and ""stronger"" would be ""stronger on the strength""? Looks like if we are talking about opinions it rather your opinion what words mean.
Palm_Tree_Island: No, fastest would mean that individuals strength is speed and thus equips them to be the fittest of their species. Just like you say “the chameleon’s strength is it’s camouflage.” Here’s a definition for you since you wanna suggest that my use of strength is an opinion lol. 

Strength (Noun) : a good or beneficial quality or attribute of a person or thing.

So yes, survival of the fittest does in fact mean survival of the strongest, being strongest has nothing to do with physical ability to lift something.
peelen: &gt;survival of the fittest does in fact mean survival of the strongest, being strongest has nothing to do with physical ability to lift something.

And explain me how does it means something different than what I wrote?

I mean your and mine sentence mean ""not only physical strength"" yet mine is opinion, and yours is fact.
Palm_Tree_Island: Again read the definition for strength.

Strength (Noun) : a good or beneficial quality or attribute of a person or thing.

By this definition, survival of the fittest is the same as survival of the strongest. They are the same thing.
peelen: Again how does ""fastest"" doesn't mean  a good or beneficial quality of being fast?
Palm_Tree_Island: Your initial post is that survival of the fittest is not always survival of the strongest. We both agree that being the fastest also makes that individual the strongest. By this logic you have just stated that the fastest is the strongest, thus survival of the fittest is survival of the strongest.
peelen: And we both understood that in this statement “strongest” means physical strength, and we both “understood” overall message of it. 

I might agree that it was worded poorly, but that doesn’t make it “opinion”.
Palm_Tree_Island: No, strongest does not mean physical strength. This is what I am saying. Strongest has nothing to do with physical strength. Cooperative learning can be a strength. This is where you are wrong
peelen: So if word it like that:  


""YSK that surviving of the fittest does not mean surviving of the physically strongest""  


That would stopped being ""opinion""?
Palm_Tree_Island: No

One possible explanation for the lower disk fraction in Taurus is that the region is in a later stage of star formation, where many of the disks have already dissipated due to interactions with the surrounding environment. Alternatively, the lower disk fraction could be due to the fact that Taurus is a more distant region, making it more difficult to detect disks at longer wavelengths. Future studies will need to investigate these possibilities further to understand the reasons behind the observed disk fraction in Taurus.

In addition to the disk fraction, we have also measured the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the Taurus members, which provide valuable information about the properties of the disks and the central stars. The SEDs show a range of characteristics, including a strong infrared excess, indicative of the presence of a disk, and a weak near-infrared excess, suggesting that the disk is either small or has a low temperature. The SEDs also reveal a clear dependence on stellar mass, with more massive stars having more luminous disks.

The Taurus star-forming region is a unique laboratory for studying the early stages of star formation, and the data presented here provide valuable insights into the properties of the region. Future studies will focus on using these data to investigate the role of disks in the star formation process, as well as the impact of the surrounding environment on the evolution of the stars and their disks."," lower (20%) in IC 348 and Sigma Ori, which are denser than Taurus and Cha I and are roughly coeval with the latter. These data indicate that disk lifetimes for solar-mass stars are longer in regions that have lower stellar densities. Through an analysis of multiple epochs of photometry that are available for ~200 Taurus members, we find that stars with disks exhibit significantly greater mid-IR variability than diskless stars. Finally, we have used our data in Taurus to refine the criteria for primordial, evolved, and transitional disks. The number ratio of evolved and transitional disks to primordial disks in Taurus is 15/98 for K5-M5, indicating a timescale of 0.15 x tau(primordial)=0.45 Myr for the clearing of the inner regions of optically thick disks. After applying the same criteria to older clusters (2-10 Myr), we find that the proportions of evolved and transitional disks in those populations are consistent with the measurements in Taurus when their star formation histories are properly taken into account. ERRATUM: In Table 7, we inadvertently omitted the spectral type bins in which class II sources were placed in Table 8 based on their bolometric luminosities (applies only to stars that lack spectroscopic classifications). The bins were K6-M3.5 for FT Tau, DK Tau B, and IRAS 04370+2559, M3.5-M6 for IRAS 04200+2759, IT Tau B, and ITG 1, and M6-M8 for IRAS 04325+2402 C.

Personally, I think it's attractive when someone can take a joke and not get too worked up about it.  It shows they're not easily swayed by opinions of others and are comfortable in their own skin.  Of course, this is not always the case, and some girls might see it as a sign of weakness or a lack of confidence.  But for me, it's a major turn-on when someone can laugh at themselves and not take everything so seriously.

I also think it's important to consider the context and the type of teasing.  If the teasing is mean-spirited or targeted at someone's vulnerabilities, it's definitely not okay.  But if it's playful and light-hearted, I think it can be a fun way to build rapport and create a sense of camaraderie.  In those cases, I think it's even more impressive when someone can shrug it off and not get too caught up in the drama.

Ultimately, I think it's all about the way the guy carries himself and how he responds to the teasing.  If he's confident, humble, and can take a joke, I think it's a major plus in my book.

(..It tells a lot about who they are and how their mind works. You can guess a lot of information by doing this)
FortFighter: Thank you! Haha I guess I didn't realize it was a unique skill or anything!

I suppose I realized this around middle school age.  In elementary school I was teased quite a bit,  but I never really thought much of it.  However with puberty came self awareness.  I didn't want to be teased, so I just thought ""well let's watch how everyone else behaves, and from that information I can decide how I would like to be"".

It really helped me figure out what kind of person I wanted to be.  I'm the person who likes to come to others defence when I can clearly tell they need it,  or to  tell an offending person to buzz off. If I notice those things,  why not put it to good use! :)

Edit: I forgot to mention that I think it's fantastic that you want to be more observant of others! It's so obvious once you start paying attention! Use your wisdom to help others out :)
SpriteFizz: Yeah! like you can really go down the rabbit hole by listening to what people say.. I knew this to an extent but when I read what you said it hit me. Like just thinking about my mom - for a simple example - she sometimes shares her knowledge &amp; advice about money related stuff or being open to experience. Now if I do what you do, I can I think about what she talks about and I can then objectively see and conclude she must have some experience in life, which I can then ask about if I wanted to learn or know more. Maybe ask her something like, how did she come to be so smart with practical stuff, if she had to become independent at a young age or something along the lines of that or I can ask her if she has always been open to experience as she is. 

That's great you learned how to be more of what you wanted to be like and impressive in middle school. Yeah that's pretty cool you picked up on some traits of someone who can come to others defense. So basically we can observe how people act and see if we like what we see or not. Thanks for sharing :)

Furthermore, this equivalence can be extended to the study of the level sets of the Hamiltonians. The level sets of H + u and H/(1 -- u) are diffeomorphic, which means that they are homeomorphic and have the same topological properties. This diffeomorphism can be constructed by using the flow of the Hamiltonian vector field of H + u and the flow of the Hamiltonian vector field of H/(1 -- u). This diffeomorphism is called a symplectomorphism, and it preserves the symplectic structure of the phase space.

The equivalence between perturbations by a small additive potential and perturbations by a positive factor close to one has important consequences for the study of the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. For example, it allows us to use the theory of perturbations of Hamiltonian systems to study the behavior of systems which are close to a given Hamiltonian system. This is particularly useful in the study of the stability of equilibrium points of Hamiltonian systems, as well as in the study of the behavior of systems which are close to a given equilibrium point.

In addition, the equivalence between perturbations by a small additive potential and perturbations by a positive factor close to one has important implications for the study of the geometry of the phase space of Hamiltonian systems. For example, it allows us to use the theory of symplectic geometry to study the properties of the level sets of Hamiltonians, and to understand the behavior of the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems in terms of the geometry of the phase space.

Moreover, the equivalence between perturbations by a small additive potential and perturbations by a positive factor close to one has important consequences for the study of the thermodynamics of Hamiltonian systems. For example, it allows us to use the theory of thermodynamics to study the behavior of systems which are close to a given equilibrium point, and to understand the behavior of the thermodynamic properties of Hamiltonian systems in terms of the geometry of the phase space.

In conclusion, the equivalence between perturbations by a small additive potential and perturbations by a positive factor close to one is a fundamental concept in the study of Hamiltonian systems, and it has important implications for the study of the dynamics, geometry, and thermodynamics of these systems."," on this energy surface are reparametrisation of each other, this is the Maupertuis principle. This remark is particularly relevant when H is homogeneous in the fibers (which corresponds to Finsler metrics) or even fiberwise quadratic (which corresponds to Riemannian metrics). In these cases, perturbations by potentials of the Hamiltonian correspond, up to parametrisation, to conformal perturbations of the metric. One of the widely studied aspects is to understand to what extent the return map associated to a periodic orbit can be perturbed by adding a small potential. This kind of question depend strongly on the context in which they are posed. Some of the most studied contexts are, in increasing order of difficulty, perturbations of general vector fields, perturbations of Hamiltonian systems inside the class of Hamiltonian systems, perturbations of Riemannian metrics inside the class of Riemannian metrics, Ma{\~n}{\'e} perturbations of convex Hamiltonians. It is for example well-known that each vector field can be perturbed to a vector field with only hyperbolic periodic orbits, this is part of the Kupka-Smale theorem, see [5, 13]. There is no such result in the context of Hamiltonian vector fields, but it remains true that each Hamiltonian can be perturbed to a Hamiltonian with only non-degenerate periodic orbits (including the iterated ones), see [11, 12]. The same result is true in the context of Riemannian metrics: every Riemannian metric can be perturbed to a Riemannian metric with only non-degenerate closed geodesics, this is the bumpy metric theorem, see [4, 2, 1]. The question was investigated only much more recently in the context of Ma{\~n}{\'e} perturbations of convex Hamiltonians, see [9, 10]. It is proved in [10] that the same result holds : If H is a convex Hamiltonian and a is a regular value of H, then there exist arbitrarily small potentials u such that all periodic orbits (including iterated ones) of H + u at energy a are non-degenerate. The proof given in [10] is actually rather similar to the ones given in papers on the perturbations of Riemannian metrics. In all these proofs, it is very useful to work"
sad,id1326,human," indicates a non-trivial relationship between the fluid-particle acceleration and the kinetic energy, is found to be consistent with the results obtained from direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows. Furthermore, the conditional statistics of the fluid-particle acceleration reveal a strong correlation with the local dissipation rate, suggesting that the acceleration is closely linked to the energy dissipation process in turbulent flows.

In particular, the analysis shows that the fluid-particle acceleration exhibits a distinct behavior in the vicinity of the dissipation rate, where the acceleration is found to be significantly enhanced compared to the rest of the flow. This enhancement is attributed to the presence of intense vortical structures, which are responsible for the energy dissipation and the acceleration of the fluid particles. The results also indicate that the fluid-particle acceleration is sensitive to the Reynolds number, with higher Reynolds numbers leading to a more pronounced exponential growth of the acceleration. This finding is consistent with the idea that the small-scale dynamics of turbulence become increasingly important at higher Reynolds numbers, leading to a more complex behavior of the fluid-particle acceleration.

The implications of these findings are significant, as they suggest that the fluid-particle acceleration can be used as a diagnostic tool to study the small-scale dynamics of turbulence and the energy dissipation process in turbulent flows. Additionally, the results highlight the importance of considering the conditional statistics of the fluid-particle acceleration in order to gain a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between the acceleration, the kinetic energy, and the dissipation rate in turbulent flows."," departs from the previous propositions, reflects additional kinematic effects of the flow structures on the acceleration. Regarding intermittency, to account for the persistence of the effect of the large-scales on the dissipation rate, it is further proposed scaling laws for the Reynolds number dependence of the conditional and unconditional acceleration variance using Barenblatt's incomplete similarity framework. It is then shown that both these intermittency and kinematic effects can be combined in a multiplicative cascade process for the acceleration depending on the kinetic energy and the dissipation rate. On the basis of these observations, we introduce a vectorial stochastic model for the dynamics of a tracer in turbulent flows. This model incorporates a fractional log-normal process for the dissipation rate recently proposed, as well as an additional hypothesis regarding non-diagonal terms in the diffusion tensor which naturally leads to the decomposition between tangential and centripetal acceleration. This model is shown to be in good agreement with direct numerical simulations and presents the essential characteristics of the Lagrangian turbulence highlighted in recent years, namely (i) non-Gaussian acceleration, (ii) scale separation between the norm of the acceleration and its components, (iii) anomalous scaling law for the Lagrangian velocity spectra, and (iv) negative skewness of the increments of the mechanical power, reflecting the temporal irreversibility of the dynamics."

It was amazing to be able to breathe freely, without the constant congestion and sneezing. My quality of life improved dramatically, and I was finally able to participate in activities that I had been avoiding due to my allergies.

The injections were a bit uncomfortable, but the benefits far outweighed the minor discomfort. I would also experience some mild side effects, such as itching and swelling at the injection site, but these were temporary and manageable.

danjo_kandui: Ha! Now that would be something to see. But for now, let's just enjoy the fact that we're getting a glimpse into the war from multiple angles. It's not often that we get to see this kind of transparency.

danjo_kandui: That's not an excuse in 2022. They were able to capture combat footage in World War II. Today, they have body cams, and drones and the military is standardly equipped with cameras.

So why wouldn't there be any footage of actual combat?
kida182001: Excuse or not, not all militaries are modernized, even in 2022. Mounted cameras on soldiers are not really the norm.
danjo_kandui: But given the numbers this post is claiming, there would 100% be at least one video of actual combat. 

Do you honestly expect me to believe that in 2022, there's not a single camera capturing any of the actual combat fighting happening in Ukraine?
kida182001: I guess since neither of us (me for sure) is there in the heart of the shitstorm, everything we say is still just speculation. I replied in another post saying that even if the more accurate numbers are half this, it’s still a pretty significant loss for a supposedly more advanced military.
danjo_kandui: But I'm saying that the lack of a single combat video shows that there isn't an invasion and the whole thing is western propaganda.
kida182001: Oh. If that’s where you’re coming from, then there’s nothing else I can say now is there.
danjo_kandui: Pretty much. I was asking for a single video of actual combat happening. If that doesn't exist, then you're right. There's really nothing else you can say.
kida182001: Well I guess one way to find out is becoming an eyewitness yourself. You can fly to Romania, which borders Ukraine and is a Nato country so you should be fine. Then try to hitch a ride into Kyiv or one of the supposedly conflict zones that have been reported by Western media. Then report back to us with your findings.
danjo_kandui: Why should I need to do all that? I'm asking for a single video of actual combat in Ukraine. 

Am I just supposed to imagine Ukraine is in active combat with Russia?
kida182001: Well like I said, if you can’t find a single video, best way is to find out and get one yourself to prove to the rest of us it’s all sunshine and rainbows over there right now.
danjo_kandui: How can I find Santa Claus? He doesn't exist. Also, active combat footage of the Russian invasion doesn't exist. Would that be in the same place?
kida182001: You’re not trying to find a person that doesn’t exist, you’re trying to find an event that you claim doesn’t exist. The best way to find out is to go to the location where the supposed event is taking place to see if it’s there or not.
danjo_kandui: I'm saying that if somebody is making a claim, like a Russian invasion claim, they should be able to show the proof I'm asking for that would prove their claim. If they can't do that, I'm not going to waste my time and money traveling the world, researching something that is obviously a lie.

I was told by the AT&amp;T representative that this was a standard practice and that I had no choice but to accept the new charge. I was frustrated and decided to escalate the issue by filing an FCC complaint. The process was surprisingly straightforward and only took a few minutes to complete. I submitted my complaint and waited to see what would happen.

A few days later, I received an email from AT&amp;T stating that they were investigating my complaint and would be in touch with me shortly. I was skeptical, but I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. A week went by, and I received another email from AT&amp;T stating that they had reviewed my complaint and were willing to waive the administrative charge for the remainder of my contract. I was thrilled and relieved that the issue had been resolved in my favor.

This experience has taught me the importance of being proactive and standing up for my rights as a consumer. The FCC complaint process is an effective tool for resolving disputes with service providers and can be a powerful way to advocate for yourself. I encourage anyone who feels that their rights have been violated to take the time to file a complaint and fight for what is rightfully theirs.

In conclusion, the power of an FCC complaint is not to be underestimated. It can be a powerful tool for consumers to hold service providers accountable for their actions and to ensure that they are treated fairly and with respect. I am grateful for the outcome of my complaint and hope that my experience will serve as a reminder to others of the importance of standing up for their rights and fighting for what is rightfully theirs."," agree that State and Federal Universal Service Fees and other governmentally imposed fees, whether or not assessed directly upon you, may be increased based upon the government's or our calculations.

As expected, the AT&amp;T customer service supervisor's response was that they couldn't do that because the FCC allows companies to introduce new ""Administrative Charges"". So, I filed a complaint with the FCC using [this form](https://esupport.fcc.gov/ccmsforms/form2000.action?form_type=2000B) and simply explaining why I thought the new charges were a huge violation of my contract. Honestly, I thought that was it; my complaint would be lost in the brouhaha of bureaucracy and I would have to to finish out the rest of my contract. But, today, I got a call from a high ranking AT&amp;T customer service official who gave me an extra month to port my number over to another carrier and then receive a refund for the ETF that I would have to pay. He mentioned the FCC complaint multiple times during our conversation and seemed very concerned that it be resolved as quickly as possible. So, after the call I realized how much more the FCC Complaint did than I expected and I wanted to share it so that anyone in a similar situation could use it to their advantage.

As I grew older, I began to appreciate the complexity and beauty of the natural world, and the safari experience only strengthened my connection to it. I started to read more about the animals and their habitats, and I even started to learn some basic conservation techniques. It was amazing to see how much impact a single person could have on the environment, and it made me realize that even small actions could add up to make a big difference.

Now, as an adult, I make it a point to visit the safari as often as I can, and I always try to learn something new about the animals and the ecosystem. I've even started to volunteer with some conservation organizations, and it's been an incredible experience. Seeing the impact that we can have on the environment, and knowing that I'm making a difference, is an incredible feeling.

But even with all the amazing experiences I've had, nothing compares to that first night safari when I was 6. It was like nothing I had ever seen before, and it left a deep impression on me. It made me realize that the natural world is full of wonder and awe, and that even the most intense and brutal moments can be beautiful in their own way.

PeasKhichra: 14 spotted hyenas chased down a Kudu and brutally devoured it inside a Zimbabwean Safari Resort foyer at night. Residents woke up and saw this first thing in the morning.

PsychologicalSpace50: Now this is the all inclusive safari stay I'm looking for.
maikelele20: Honestly, of this happened to me I would just stare in amazement. Nature is fucking metal.
L1llI4n: I actually was on a night safari where we followed some lions hunting and killing and eating a zebra, we followed them and stayed till the lions left and the hyenas came and ate the rest.

It's funny how life works out, isn't it? Sometimes the most intense and brutal moments can be the ones that leave the deepest impressions on us. And sometimes, it takes a little bit of chaos and destruction to remind us of the beauty and wonder of the natural world."," cubs... That was pure nature.

I’m friends with a lot of vegans and I think some that make choices just because they don’t want to hurt any animal tend to get a little weird. Find a vegan that makes choices from a purely environmental perspective. Those fuckers know some shit. Friends with one that sees no issue with hunting.  He’s just not inclined to do so himself
neytiri10: I can appreciate people who hunt and eat what they kill but chances are, if I had to hunt and kill my own food, I would be eating a lot of weeds and tree bark.
TryingDrying: Failed environmental vegan here!

I want to hunt because of the morality &amp; sustainability.
Spoonloops: I don’t think it would be sustainable if everyone started hunting with our current population though.
TryingDrying: If you look at the stats, as long as hunters were following sustainable practices, it would greatly reduce environmental damage. Of course, we can't just go hunting populations to extinction as we've done in the past (see: carrier pigeons, etc.).


 It would be a part of environmental management -- culling and the like. Also, the hunting input is a much higher barrier than going to the grocery store. Either by practical capacity or prep-induced respect, I think people would appreciate the sanctity of life more &amp; eat less meat. 

For the most part, hunters use all parts of the animal. You also contend with population regeneration and are forced to modulate habits accordingly.

I completely agree with BosBatMan's statement. Having a lower body fat percentage is crucial in achieving the V-line look. However, it's not just about having a low body fat percentage, but also about having a well-balanced physique. To get the V-line, you need to have a combination of strong and toned muscles, particularly in your obliques, lower back, and glutes.

In addition to having a low body fat percentage, you also need to focus on building muscle mass in these areas. This can be achieved through a combination of resistance training, cardio, and proper nutrition. Here are some exercises that can help you achieve the V-line:

1. Plank: This is an isometric exercise that targets your core muscles, including your obliques. Hold a plank position for 30-60 seconds, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat for 3-5 sets.
2. Russian twists: This exercise targets your obliques and can be done with a weight or without. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Twist your torso to the left and right, touching your hands to the ground each time. Do 3 sets of 15-20 reps.
3. Leg raises: This exercise targets your lower abs and can be done with a weight or without. Lie on your back with your arms extended overhead and raise your legs straight up towards the ceiling. Lower your legs back down to the starting position and repeat for 3 sets of 15-20 reps.
4. Superman: This exercise targets your lower back and glutes. Lie on your stomach with your arms extended in front of you and lift your arms, shoulders, and legs off the ground. Hold for 30-60 seconds, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat for 3-5 sets.
5. Deadlifts: This exercise targets your glutes, hamstrings, and lower back. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a weight or barbell with your hands shoulder-width apart. Lift the weight up to your hips, squeezing your glutes and lower back muscles as you lift. Lower the weight back down to the starting position and repeat for 3 sets of 8-12 reps.

In addition to these exercises, it's also important to incorporate cardio into your workout routine to help you lose body fat and reveal the V-line. Some effective cardio exercises include running, cycling, and swimming.

Remember, achieving the V-line takes time and dedication. It's important to be patient and consistent with your workout routine and nutrition plan. With the right combination of exercise and nutrition, you can achieve the toned and defined physique you desire."," to form the V-shape i.e. shoulders (deltoids) and the lats, and even serratus anterior.  

So *training obliques* can mean different things, and it was not clear from your comments.  Are you trying to get a stronger ""core"" including your internal and external obliques?  Did you want to have larger external obliques i.e. gain mass in this specific area?


Pepperr08: Apologies, I would like to get a stronger core. Including external internal obliques. I feel like it’ll help me with my all around movements when I perform lifting activities. 
BosBatMan: Ok - stronger core it is!  Then you need to have a good core conditioning and strengthening routine.  I don't know your current fitness level,  height and weight, but there are different BWF and weight-assisted exercises that will strengthen your core including Abs, Obliques, Lower Back, etc.  

Have you read about the Core Triplet in the RR?  This is a beginner routine for core conditioning, that will scale as you progress.  There are of course more advanced core exercises which will build strength when you are ready.

If you want that six-pack after all, then it's relatively easy - just get your body fat percentage to about 10% and you'll see those ab muscles.  So you can do that in the kitchen and not in the gym.

By ""strong core"" do you have a desire to someday to be able to do strength elements like the Human Flag, Dragon Flag, Back Lever, Front Lever, and others?  All of those levers require a strong core as a foundation.

If you want to train for the Dragon Flag, which is one of my favorites, you can start with beginner progressions.  In this video I should **[5 Dragon Flag progressions](https://flic.kr/p/2cBNEM7)** to get you up to a Full DF.

I mean, can you imagine if someone wrote a review for a car dealership saying that the salesperson was terrible, but didn't specify which salesperson or which model they were looking at? It would be completely useless and frustrating for the business to try to improve. And yet, this is exactly what happens when people write reviews for the mall or building instead of the actual business. It's like they're expecting the mall to magically fix the problem or take responsibility for the issue, which is just not how it works.

And it's not just the businesses that suffer from this. The customers who read these reviews are also misled and misinformed. They might think that the mall as a whole is terrible, or that the entire complex has a poor reputation, when in reality, it's just one specific business that had a bad experience. This can lead to a loss of trust and a negative perception of the entire area, which can be devastating for local businesses.

I've seen this happen firsthand, where a business with a great reputation and excellent customer service is dragged down by a single bad review that was written for the wrong place. It's heartbreaking to see a business struggle because of someone else's laziness or ignorance. And it's not just the business owners who suffer, it's also the employees who work hard every day to provide excellent service and products, only to have their hard work undone by a careless review.

So, to all the Yelpers out there, please take a moment to think before you write your review. Take a deep breath, and ask yourself, ""Am I reviewing the actual business, or am I just venting about the mall?"" It's not that hard, folks. Just take a minute to specify which business you're reviewing, and make sure it's the correct one. Your fellow customers, and the businesses themselves, will thank you."," is when people start a review acknowledging that *""This isn't for the \[mall/building name\], but for the \[insert business\]...""* You should write for the actual business then -- meaning look for the listing, or create one for it (although I'm sure people are too lazy to do the latter).

I also don’t think it’s smart to upload selfies and totally unrelated photos to a business listing (I’ve seen pics of people in their backyard for a mall listing, vain selfies from girls, etc.). I don’t believe there is a business impact to this, but it just makes you look dumb. 🤷🏻‍♂️

**Why YSK:** Yelp reviews have a really big impact on a business. Star ratings really matter, especially when people are spending seconds scanning their phone to see what's rated as good and what's not. Please be thoughtful of businesses.
sliight: Even better, tell everyone you know not to not use Yelp.

It's bad enough that they essentially extort money from businesses, but from a user standpoint they don't list every business. I'm fine if the non paying businesses are last, but the app is fairly useless when it leaves out what you're looking for.

If I look for restaurants, I want to see them all within specified distance. There's plenty of great places that don't waste the money on yelp as they don't need to, so the user misses out on them if they don't use better search options.
boafriend: I hear you. I’ve heard shady things about some listing manipulation despite Yelp claiming they don’t engage in such practices. But at the end of the day, it is still a huge platform a lot of consumers turn to for trust and info, so I still think it’s important to maintain accuracy of reviews.
sliight: Definitely agree there. I know business owners that check every review. It's frustrating when I see people leave negative reviews for dumb reasons as it can really hurt business, especially if new.

Just wish they'd list everyone so there would be more value for the actually consumer they target.
boafriend: At the end of the day, they are a business, and like many social platforms, you have to pay for greater exposure. I know paid listings show up at the top (like Google Ads), but IDK how the rest of their algorithm works for listings. You can always use the filters to narrow your search by star-rating or popularity and such tho, which is helpful. I do think they need something in place to field these stupid reviews that I speak of in my original post though. I know Yelp already has an algorithm that hides reviews it deems as unreliable (the “hidden” reviews) but 🤷🏻‍♂️. People will write non-related reviews a lot out of sheer laziness though.
sliight: I agree that they're for profit, I don't use as they literally exclude businesses. I know I'll end up searching elsewhere to get all the restaurants in the area so I just uninstalled their app and never think to use them anymore. Too often on vacation they exclude top places to eat when those places don't pay as they are busy enough... I'd love to use them if they'd just put everyone on.

The potential applications of Skini are vast and varied. For instance, it could be used to create immersive and dynamic soundscapes for film and video games, or to generate unique and engaging musical experiences for live performances. Additionally, Skini could be used to explore new forms of musical collaboration, where the audience is not just a passive listener, but an active participant in the creation of the music.

One of the key challenges in developing Skini is finding a balance between the structure and freedom of the music. On one hand, the composer needs to have a clear vision of the overall structure and direction of the piece, while on the other hand, the audience needs to have the freedom to influence the music and make it their own. This balance is crucial in creating a engaging and dynamic musical experience.

Another challenge is the development of algorithms and techniques that can effectively capture and respond to the audience's input. This requires a deep understanding of music theory, psychology, and human-computer interaction. Furthermore, the system needs to be able to adapt to different contexts and environments, such as different venues, instruments, and cultural settings.

In terms of future work, there are many potential directions to explore. For instance, the system could be extended to include more advanced features, such as machine learning algorithms that can learn from the audience's preferences and adapt the music accordingly. Additionally, the system could be used to create new forms of musical notation and composition, where the score is not just a static representation of the music, but a dynamic and interactive process.

Overall, Skini has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about music and its relationship with the audience. By providing a platform for composers to create dynamic and interactive music, Skini opens up new possibilities for musical expression and collaboration.","? These are important questions for the Skini system but they are out of the scope of this paper that focuses exclusively on the computer science aspects of the system. From that perspective, the main questions are how to program the scores and in which language? General purpose languages are inappropriate because their elementary constructs (i.e., variables, functions, loops, etc.) do not match the constructions needed to express music and musical constraints. We show that synchronous programming languages are a much better fit because they rely on temporal constructs that can be directly used to represent musical scores and because their malleability enables composers to experiment easily with artistic variations of their initial scores. The paper mostly focuses on scores programming. It exposes the process a composer should follow from his very first musical intuitions up to the generation of a musical artifact. The paper presents some excerpts of the programming of a classical music composition that it then precisely relates to an actual recording. Examples of techno music and jazz are also presented, with audio artifact, to demonstrate the versatility of the system. Finally, brief presentations of past live concerts are presented as an evidence of viability of the system."

To alleviate this issue, researchers have proposed various solutions, such as using domain-specific languages (DSLs) to define the grammar of the object language, or using metacompilers to generate the necessary grammars automatically. However, these solutions are not without their own set of challenges and limitations. For example, DSLs can be difficult to learn and use, especially for non-technical users, and metacompilers can be complex and error-prone to implement.

Another approach is to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and generate syntax trees. This can be done by using machine learning algorithms to learn the patterns and structures of the object language, and then using these patterns to generate syntax trees. This approach has the potential to be more flexible and scalable than traditional meta programming systems, but it also requires a large amount of training data and can be sensitive to the quality of the training data.

In addition, some researchers have proposed using type theory and category theory to provide a more formal and abstract representation of the object language, which can be used to define the grammar and semantics of the language. This approach has the potential to provide a more rigorous and formal foundation for meta programming, but it also requires a deep understanding of type theory and category theory.

In conclusion, meta programming is a complex and challenging field, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the problem of matching and creating syntax trees. However, by using a combination of techniques, such as DSLs, metacompilers, NLP, and type theory, researchers can develop more flexible, scalable, and robust meta programming systems that can handle a wide range of object languages and syntax trees."," process, especially for realistic languages such as Java and C++. Approach: In this paper we present Concretely, a technique to extend meta programming systems with pluggable concrete syntax patterns, based on external, black box parsers. We illustrate Concretely in the context of Rascal, an open-source meta programming system and language workbench, and show how to reuse existing parsers for Java, JavaScript, and C++. Furthermore, we propose Tympanic, a DSL to declaratively map external AST structures to Rascal's internal data structures. Tympanic allows implementors of Concretely to solve the impedance mismatch between object-oriented class hierarchies in Java and Rascal's algebraic data types. Both the algebraic data type and AST marshalling code is automatically generated. Knowledge: The conceptual architecture of Concretely and Tympanic supports the reuse of pre-existing, external parsers, and their AST representation in meta programming systems that feature concrete syntax patterns for matching and constructing syntax trees. As such this opens up concrete syntax pattern matching for a host of realistic languages for which writing a grammar from scratch is time consuming and error-prone, but for which industry-strength parsers exist in the wild. Grounding: We evaluate Concretely in terms of source lines of code (SLOC), relative to the size of the AST data type and marshalling code. We show that for real programming languages such as C++ and Java, adding support for concrete syntax patterns takes an effort only in the order of dozens of SLOC. Similarly, we evaluate Tympanic in terms of SLOC, showing an order of magnitude of reduction in SLOC compared to manual implementation of the AST data types and marshalling code. Importance: Meta programming has applications in reverse engineering, reengineering, source code analysis, static analysis, software renovation, domain-specific language engineering, and many others. Processing of syntax trees is central to all of these tasks. Concrete syntax patterns improve the practice of constructing meta programs. The combination of Concretely and Tympanic has the potential to make concrete syntax patterns available with very little effort, thereby improving and promoting the application of meta programming in the general software engineering context."

The proposed framework is particularly useful for computing greeks of complex financial instruments, such as those with multiple underlying assets or those that depend on stochastic volatility. The combined use of Vibrato and automatic differentiation allows for a more accurate and efficient computation of greeks, which is essential for risk management and portfolio optimization. The framework is also flexible and can be adapted to different types of financial contracts and models.

In addition to the theoretical framework, we also provide several examples of applications of the proposed method. We demonstrate its effectiveness in computing greeks for European and American options, as well as for multidimensional Basket Call and stochastic volatility models. We also show how the method can be used to compute derivatives for the Longstaff-Schwartz Monte Carlo method for American options.

The proposed method has several advantages over existing methods. Firstly, it is more accurate than standard finite difference methods, which can be prone to numerical errors. Secondly, it is more stable than automatic differentiation of second order derivatives, which can be sensitive to the choice of parameters. Finally, it is more general than Malliavin Calculus, which is limited to certain types of financial contracts.

In conclusion, this paper presents a novel framework for computing second or higher order greeks of financial securities. The proposed method combines the advantages of Vibrato and automatic differentiation and is more accurate, stable, and general than existing methods. We believe that this framework will be a valuable tool for risk managers and portfolio managers, and will contribute to the development of more sophisticated financial models."," derivatives of options with non-twice differentiable payoff. 1. Introduction. Due to BASEL III regulations, banks are requested to evaluate the sensitivities of their portfolios every day (risk assessment). Some of these portfolios are huge and sensitivities are time consuming to compute accurately. Faced with the problem of building a software for this task and distrusting automatic differentiation for non-differentiable functions, we turned to an idea developed by Mike Giles called Vibrato. Vibrato at core is a differentiation of a combination of likelihood ratio method and pathwise evaluation. In Giles [12], [13], it is shown that the computing time, stability and precision are enhanced compared with numerical differentiation of the full Monte Carlo path. In many cases, double sensitivities, i.e. second derivatives with respect to parameters, are needed (e.g. gamma hedging). Finite difference approximation of sensitivities is a very simple method but its precision is hard to control because it relies on the appropriate choice of the increment. Automatic differentiation of computer programs bypass the difficulty and its computing cost is similar to finite difference, if not cheaper. But in finance the payoff is never twice differentiable and so generalized derivatives have to be used requiring approximations of Dirac functions of which the precision is also doubtful. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of Vibrato for second and higher derivatives. We will first compare Vibrato applied twice with the analytic differentiation of Vibrato and show that it is equivalent, as the second is easier we propose the best compromise for second derivatives: Automatic Differentiation of Vibrato.

I couldn't agree more with [deleted]. It's easy to romanticize Peter Dinklage's decision to turn down the role, but let's not forget that he's a successful actor with a comfortable life. He doesn't have to worry about making ends meet or struggling to make a name for himself in the industry. He's in a position where he can afford to be picky about the projects he takes on.

But what about the people who aren't as fortunate? The ones who are struggling to make a living, who are fighting for their rights, and who are standing up for what they believe in despite the personal costs? They're the ones who are truly admirable, not Peter Dinklage.

Take, for example, the activists who are fighting against systemic racism and inequality. They're the ones who are putting their lives on the line, who are facing harassment and intimidation, and who are sacrificing their personal safety and well-being for the greater good. They're the ones who are truly standing up for their principles, not Peter Dinklage.

Or take the whistleblowers who are speaking out against corruption and abuse of power. They're the ones who are risking their careers, their reputations, and even their freedom to expose the truth. They're the ones who are putting their principles above their personal interests, not Peter Dinklage.

It's easy to get caught up in the celebrity culture and to admire people like Peter Dinklage for their perceived bravery, but let's not forget that there are many more people who are truly making a difference in the world. They're the ones who are fighting for justice, equality, and human rights, and they're the ones who deserve our admiration and respect.

As [deleted] said, we should be looking at the people who are making a real difference, not just the ones who are making a splash in the media. We should be celebrating the activists, the whistleblowers, and the everyday heroes who are standing up for what they believe in, not just the celebrities who are making a comfortable living.",", most of them stuck in wage slavery, continually trying to fight against a system designed to make them fail. How about the people who are whistleblowers? They stood up for their principles at the cost of their entire lives and livelihoods, what about them?

This is an actor. The problem isn't that you think they're far and few between, the problem is you're looking upward for them when you should be rescuing them from down below. You're almost never going to find anyone with principles looking ""up"", because it's a requirement of wealth that you learn how to play the game.
greyscript: Did you read the article?
[deleted]: Yes. Evidently people aren't reading what I am writing. Oh well.
greyscript: It's just hard to reconcile what it is exactly you disagree with. The article says he turned down paying gigs when he was poor because of his principles. The commenter says he admires that. Then you chime in and say he's wrong for feeling like that? I don't even understand what you're saying.
[deleted]: We should stop using stars who live relatively lucky and easy lives instead of people who actually have to deal with the severe consequences thrown at them from their principles. PEter Dinklage is *hardly* the poster boy for ""standing on principles"", he's just a famous one, and Reddit has the attention span of a Gnat. I would prefer we uphold the ideal of standing for principles to *whistleblowers*, but fuck me right?
greyscript: He says it's an admirable trait that he wishes more people possessed. And you disagree?

He's not talking about whistleblowers because this is a thread about Peter Dinklage. He chose to respond to something he enjoyed about the article. Insane, I know.
[deleted]: IF you read what I'm writing, you'd see in my *first post* I criticized him for lauding someone with an *Easy life*. He didn't actually make any real sacrifice for his ""principles"", it was an *easy* sacrifice. Even when he was ""poor"" he was nothing compared to what other people go through.
greyscript: This is why it feels like you didn't read the article. It talks about pretty awful living conditions (no heat, stove full of rats, landlord threatening to kill his parents in front of him). TO ME, that is not an easy life. Obviously there's people much worse off but I don't think it's fair to nit pick this person's totally understandable post.
[deleted]: You obviously didn't read the article. That happened during his *childhood*, unrelated to his later ability to apparently reject job (which occurred later). That has absolutely nothing to do with his principles at all (relating to the point of this article, saying nothing about childhood trauma).
[deleted]: No really, read it again. It happened as an adult when he first moved to New York. I don't know where his childhood came from.

The results of our analysis show that the action, A, is directly proportional to the charge associated with the current in the radiating system, and inversely proportional to the ratio of the length of the radiating system and its radius. This means that as the charge associated with the current increases, the action also increases, but as the ratio of the length of the radiating system and its radius increases, the action decreases. This is because the energy of the radiation is proportional to the square of the charge, and the duration of the radiation is inversely proportional to the ratio of the length of the radiating system and its radius.

In the frequency domain, the energy, U, dissipated in a single burst of radiation of duration T/2 is found to be directly proportional to the charge associated with the current in the radiating system, and inversely proportional to the square of the ratio of the length of the radiating system and its radius. This means that as the charge associated with the current increases, the energy dissipated in a single burst of radiation also increases, but as the ratio of the length of the radiating system and its radius increases, the energy dissipated in a single burst of radiation decreases.

Our results have important implications for the design and optimization of linear radiating systems. For example, they suggest that to maximize the action and energy of the radiation, the charge associated with the current in the radiating system should be maximized, while the ratio of the length of the radiating system and its radius should be minimized. This could be achieved by using materials with high conductivity and high permittivity, and by designing the radiating system to have a large cross-sectional area and a small radius.

Furthermore, our results could be used to improve the efficiency of linear radiating systems by minimizing the energy dissipated in a single burst of radiation. This could be achieved by using materials with low conductivity and low permittivity, and by designing the radiating system to have a small cross-sectional area and a large radius.

In conclusion, our analysis of the electromagnetic fields of linear radiating systems working without dispersive and dissipative losses has shown that the action and energy of the radiation vary as a function of the charge associated with the current in the radiating system and the ratio of the length of the radiating system and its radius. Our results have important implications for the design and optimization of linear radiating systems, and could be used to improve their efficiency and performance.",". We have observed remarkable results when this ratio is equal to the ratio of the radius of the universe to the Bohr radius. In the case of the time domain radiating system, we have observed that when the charge associated with the current propagating along the radiator reaches the electronic charge, the action associated with the radiation reduces to h/2*pi where h is the Planck constant. In the case of the frequency domain radiating system, we have observed that as the magnitude of the oscillating charge reduces to the electronic charge, the energy dissipated in a single burst of radiation reduces to h*v, where v is the frequency of oscillation. Interestingly, all these results are based purely on classical electrodynamics and general relativity. The importance of the findings is discussed. In particular, the fact that the minimum free charge that exists in nature is the electronic charge, is shown for the first time to be a direct consequence of the photonic nature of the electromagnetic fields. Furthermore, the presented findings allow to derive for the first time an expression for the dark energy density of the universe in terms of the other fundamental constants in nature, the prediction of which is consistent with experimental observations. This Equation, which combines together the dark energy, electronic charge and mass, speed of light, gravitational constant and Planck constant, creates a link between classical field theories (i.e., classical electrodynamics and general relativity) and quantum mechanics."

Specifically, we will investigate the asymptotic behavior of the probability of large deviations of the realized (co-)volatility from its mean, which is essential for understanding the tail behavior of the realized (co-)volatility. This is particularly important in finance, as large deviations of the realized (co-)volatility can lead to significant losses or gains for investors. Our results will provide a deeper understanding of the statistical properties of realized (co-)volatility, which can be used to improve the risk management and portfolio optimization strategies in finance."," in a fixed time interval increases to infinity. More specifically, we consider a bivariate model with synchronous observation schemes and correlated Brownian motions of the following form: $dX\_{\ell,t} = \sigma\_{\ell,t}dB\_{\ell,t}+b\_{\ell}(t,\omega)dt$ for $\ell=1,2$, where $X\_{\ell}$ denotes the log-price, we are concerned with the large deviation estimation of the vector $V\_t^n(X)=(Q\_{1,t}^n(X), Q\_{2,t}^n(X), C\_{t}^n(X))$ where $Q\_{\ell,t}^n(X)$ and $C\_{t}^n(X)$ represente the estimator of the quadratic variational processes $Q\_{\ell,t}=\int\_0^t\sigma\_{\ell,s}^2ds$ and the integrated covariance $C\_t=\int\_0^t\sigma\_{1,s}\sigma\_{2,s}\rho\_sds$ respectively, with $\rho\_t=cov(B\_{1,t}, B\_{2,t})$. Our main motivation is to improve upon the existing limit theorems. Our large deviations results can be used to evaluate and approximate tail probabilities of realized (co-)volatility. As an application we provide the large deviation for the standard dependence measures between the two assets returns such as the realized regression coefficients up to time $t$, or the realized correlation.

As we continue into the week, I'd like to remind everyone that consistency is key. It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of starting a new routine, but it's equally important to make sure you're giving your body time to recover and adapt. Don't be afraid to take rest days or modify exercises if you're feeling fatigued. Remember, progress over perfection!

For those who are just starting out, I recommend setting small, achievable goals for yourself. This could be as simple as committing to a certain number of workouts per week or increasing the difficulty of your routine by one rep or set. As you get closer to reaching your goals, you can start to set new ones and continue pushing yourself.

One of the best things about bodyweight fitness is that it's accessible to anyone, regardless of their fitness level or equipment. Whether you're a seasoned athlete or just starting out, there's always something new to learn and challenge yourself with. So don't be afraid to try new exercises or take on a new challenge – it's all part of the journey!

chocolatedessert: I've been doing the recommended routine, and I'm happy with my progress so far. (Many thanks to the community here!) I might need to put training on the back burner for a while, because life, but I'd like to maintain my current strength if I can, while cutting back on time.

How little time could I put in and hope to maintain my strength for a few months? Should I  do the RR twice a week? Once? For the strength exercises, would one set of my max reps, once a week, be enough? Or less? What do you think I could get away with?

I'll experiment, of course, but a good initial guess would be a big help. Thanks in advance for any advice.

As the rain continued to pour down, the streets of Shanghai became a sea of water, with people struggling to stay above the surface. The subway system, once a marvel of modern engineering, was now a scene of chaos and despair. Passengers were trapped, unable to escape the flooded tunnels, as the water rose higher and higher.

Meanwhile, the Chinese government was quick to respond, deploying emergency services and rescue teams to the affected areas. But despite their efforts, the scale of the disaster was too great, and many were left stranded, waiting for help to arrive.

As the situation continued to unfold, the international community began to take notice, with many expressing concern and solidarity with the people of China. But amidst the chaos and destruction, some were quick to point out the potential propaganda angle, suggesting that the government was using the disaster to distract from its own failures and human rights abuses.

But for those on the ground, the reality was far more mundane. They were simply trying to survive, to stay safe, and to rebuild their lives in the face of unimaginable tragedy. And as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, the people of China began to rebuild, to recover, and to move forward, stronger and more resilient than ever before.

Despite the challenges they faced, the Chinese people refused to be defeated, and their determination and resilience in the face of adversity was a beacon of hope for the world. And as the international community continued to watch and wait, they could not help but be impressed by the strength and resilience of the Chinese people, and the incredible story of their struggle to overcome the devastating effects of the flood.

But as the story of the flood continued to unfold, there were also questions about the role of the government in the disaster. Some accused the authorities of being slow to respond, and of prioritizing the interests of the party over the needs of the people. Others suggested that the government had been aware of the impending disaster, but had chosen to ignore it, or to downplay its severity.

As the debate continued, it became clear that the truth was far more complex, and that the government's response to the disaster was a reflection of its own strengths and weaknesses. But for the people of China, the flood was not just a natural disaster, but a wake-up call, a reminder of the importance of preparedness, and of the need for the government to prioritize the needs of its people.

And as the years went by, the people of China continued to rebuild and recover, and to work towards a brighter future. They had faced the worst of nature, and had emerged stronger and more resilient as a result. And as they looked out at the world, they knew that they were not just a nation of survivors, but a nation of heroes, who had overcome the unimaginable, and had emerged victorious."," you made a good point about infrastructure, yet nonetheless please take into consideration that it’s a very intense rainfall with a volume of 200mm in just one hour.

I’m glad to have you on my side

I’ve been to the states quite a few times btw.

lame_ass_aesthetics: totally agreed. meanwhile I don’t see why I’m hearing this. I didn’t make the insult or give the order. I’m no part of the decision making process. I’m neither in favor of nor responsible for what they do. personally I feel bad for people suffering anywhere. do you want me to apologize for what I didn’t do and never intended to do? are you experiencing certain difficulties distinguishing individuality from nationality? do you confuse me with Xi the Pooh because we both seem to have slanted eyes anyway? or are you running irritatingly low on weed? what’s up bro?

lame_ass_aesthetics: well I’m just trying to clarify a widespread misconception. you see all that downvotes and hostility? that’s ignorance up there bro.
[deleted]: Right. well my comments towards you have not been hostile at all and yet you’re accusing me of racism with your little slanted eyed comment, asking if I’m having a hard time distinguishing between government and individual (I’m assuming you mean when I said “your backyard”. Asking for clarification would have been helpful to you because I was talking about the government official who made the comments, not you), and then making a (poor) insult about my screen name. Like sorry your country is flooding, that’s awful. And politicians still shouldn’t insult other countries going through natural disasters.

Now, I know what you're thinking - ""Why can't you just pass me then?"" And the answer is, we can. But often, we're not trying to pass you, we're trying to protect you. We're trying to make sure that you're aware of any potential hazards on the road ahead, and that you have enough time to react to them. And let me tell you, it's a lot easier to react to a hazard when you see it coming, rather than when it's right in front of you.

But it's not just about protecting you, it's also about protecting ourselves. When we're riding behind you, we're putting ourselves in a position where we can see what's coming up ahead, and we can adjust our speed and position accordingly. It's a lot safer for us to be behind you, rather than trying to pass you, especially on busy roads or in heavy traffic.

And let's not forget about the benefits of having a motorcycle behind you.

We're watching out for your safety, and we're doing our best to make sure that you get to your destination safely.

So the next time you see a motorcycle riding behind you, don't be tempted to speed up or try to shake them off. Instead, take a deep breath, relax, and know that they're there to help you. They're there to protect you, and to make sure that you have a safe and enjoyable ride.

The fact is, if we want to pass you we will, and there's not a lot you can do about it. Adjusting your vehicle's travel to block our view because you think you're jamming us up isn't just a dick-move, it's  downright dangerous for us. If you drive aggressively it is possible the bike will start doing the same, and it might end badly for one or both.

People use the roads correctly, they drive cars on them. The roads were not designed for the amount of people currently using them, that is one reason why they add lanes to roads

dennis77: I understand your points, but I still believe that pirating software is not the same as stealing physical goods. The company still has the original software, and the person pirating it is not depriving them of anything. They are simply using a copy that they would have never been able to afford otherwise.

redacted187: That's a weak argument. Just because the company still has the original software doesn't mean that they didn't lose anything. They lost the potential to make a profit from that software, and that's a real loss. And as for the person pirating it, they are still using something that doesn't belong to them. It's like taking a book from a library without checking it out. Just because the library still has the book doesn't mean that it's okay to take it.

ThoDaCuppaJoe: But what about the people who can't afford the software? What about the students, the artists, the small business owners who can't afford to spend hundreds of dollars on software that they need to do their job? Are they just supposed to give up and not pursue their passion because they can't afford the software? That's not fair.

Just_Look_Around_You: I understand where you're coming from, but that's not the point. The point is that pirating software is illegal, and it's not fair to the people who do create the software. They have a right to be compensated for their work, and pirating their software is a way of taking that compensation away from them.

dennis77: But what about the people who do create the software? Don't they have a responsibility to make their software affordable and accessible to everyone? I mean, Adobe has made a lot of money from Photoshop, but they still charge an arm and a leg for it. It's like they're pricing out the very people who would benefit most from their software.

redacted187: That's a good point, but it's not like Adobe is a non-profit organization. They have to make a profit, and if they don't make a profit, they won't be able to continue creating software. And as for making the software affordable, that's a tough balance. If they make it too cheap, they won't make enough money to sustain themselves. If they make it too expensive, they'll price out the people who need it most.

ThoDaCuppaJoe: But what about the people who are willing to pay for the software, but can't because it's too expensive? Don't they deserve to have access to the software too? It's not like they're asking for a free ride, they're just asking for a fair price.

Just_Look_Around_You: I think that's a great point. Maybe instead of pirating the software, people should be advocating for more affordable pricing options. Maybe Adobe could offer a student discount, or a subscription service that's more affordable for small business owners. There are ways to make the software more accessible without resorting to piracy.

dennis77: I never thought of it that way. Maybe instead of focusing on how to get Photoshop for free, we should be focusing on how to make it more affordable for everyone. That way, everyone can have access to the software without having to resort to piracy.

redacted187: I agree. It's not about getting something for free, it's about finding a solution that works for everyone. And who knows, maybe Adobe will take notice and start offering more affordable options.

Stealing physical goods results in a financial loss for the owner. 

Copying and sharing information results in no financial loss for the 'owner'.

You buy it, you own it. I buy a painting, I can give it to who I want.
Just_Look_Around_You: It is the loss of time of whoever made it and was not fairly compensated. It is a loss of money to those who paid for it more than they should have because some folks stole it. 

Let me ask this way - if you walked into a bakery and stole a $20 cake would it be theft? Would it still be theft if you left $2 behind to pay for the cost of materials but not labour? Now imagine the same thing with intellectual property - it is the embodiment of purely labour hours. 

Also, it is a financial loss to the owner. A pretty clear one. It is lost sales. And although I'd never say 100% of piracies would occur if they were not free, there is some opportunity lost. So to say they is no financial loss for the owner is total horseshit.

sad,id1805,human," a ""grown-up"" if you're caught playing games on your phone.  In fact, many people are proud to show off their gaming skills and achievements on social media, just like kids used to do with their Gameboy.

It's not just the games themselves, but the way people interact with their phones that's similar to how kids used to interact with their Gameboy.  They're constantly checking their phones, tapping on the screen, and swiping through menus.  It's almost like they're in a trance, oblivious to the world around them.  And just like kids used to do with their Gameboy, they'll often get frustrated and angry when they can't get the game to work the way they want it to.

But what's most concerning is the impact that smartphones are having on our society.  With the constant stream of notifications, updates, and social media, it's easy to get caught up in the cycle of addiction.  People are spending more and more time staring at their screens, and less and less time engaging with the world around them.  It's like we're all just a bunch of kids glued to our Gameboy, unable to tear ourselves away from the screen.

And just like the Gameboy, smartphones are designed to be addictive.  They're designed to keep us coming back for more, to keep us engaged and entertained.  And just like the Gameboy, they're often used as a way to escape from the stresses and challenges of everyday life.  But instead of escaping into a fantasy world, we're escaping into a virtual world, where we can temporarily forget about our problems and indulge in some mindless entertainment.

But the problem is, this escape is not sustainable.  Eventually, we have to come back to reality, and the problems and challenges that we've been avoiding will still be there waiting for us.  And just like the Gameboy, smartphones are not a solution to our problems, they're just a temporary distraction.  So, let's not be fooled into thinking that our smartphones are the answer to all our problems.  Let's take a step back, and look at the world around us.  Let's engage with the people and the world around us, and let's find meaningful ways to spend our time.  Let's not let our smartphones turn us into that ""6 year old kid obsessed with his Gameboy""."," that game obsessed boy because it's not just a gaming device, but it's still the same thing.

By the way, I'm not saying our smartphone culture is bad.  I'm just saying it's out of line with the ""gameboys are only for kids"" mentality.

FaerieStories: You're missing a crucial difference: when you play a Gameboy, you are not interacting with anyone. In our society that's considered a cardinal sin at a social occasion. It's like being in a group of friends who wish to talk to you and sitting there reading a book. Smartphones, on the other hand, are (in theory) used to socialise with other people, and our society tends to see that as more acceptable. 

I'm not saying that I agree with this view. Even if the smartphone user is *actually* talking to friends and not playing Farmville, I don't think it makes it any less potentially rude in a situation where you're (physically) in a group of friends. I'm just pointing out that this is nonetheless how society has come to see smartphones - they are seen as necessary social outlets, even if the vast majority of what they're used for is firstly not social, and secondly not remotely necessary. 

**TL;DR**: *Smartphones are seen by the society as the ultimate tools to be 'sociable', and being 'sociable' is a trait our society applauds, whereas being anti-social is a trait our society scorns. So when people see a smartphone (imagined to be a device used for socialising) they condone it and when they see a Gameboy they condemn it.* 
Santa_Claauz: That's simply false. It's very common to interact with others while playing on a gameboy.
FaerieStories: OP's example though was about the sort of people who just do it on their own while in a group. Obviously he is not referring to anyone who plays Pokemon as a sort of collaborative experience.

No, a MAC address is mostly only used inside your own, local, network at layer 2 (yes I am sure there are some exceptions...). Are you refering to changing/spoofing your Modems MAC address? That would in theory work to grab another IP from your ISP as a new MAC would illicit a DHCP request, but most ISPs whitelist modems by the MAC address they require you to give them on first setup.

Just to note that this seems to be a mostly US thing, it doesn't happen in the UK or any other country I have been to.
ThisIsADogHello: I believe the same system works overseas, although in most cases you'll be using a modem provided by your ISP, in which case they already know its MAC address and don't have to ask you for it.

AFAIK, the DOCSIS spec generally only identifies the modem via the modem's MAC address. The only thing really stopping you from spoofing somebody else's MAC is two things: 1. identifying the MAC of a valid customer, and 2. modifying your modem to use this new MAC.

On the other hand, there's a major deterrent in that it'll be easy for the company to spot that there's two modems claiming to have the same MAC, and they won't have much difficulty in locating which cable segment the modems are on, and send in the police to the location not set as the billing address to deal with some charges of fraud/theft/etc.
auto98: I work for an ISP, and it definitely isn't the same.  There is no whitelisting of equipment whatsoever, you can plug in what you want.  One company tried MER (MAC encapsulated routing) but it failed badly.

sad,id856,human," creation operator. This is because the time reversal operation should not only change the direction of time but also change the direction of the creation and annihilation processes.

For instance, when a particle is created, its creation operator should be changed to the annihilation operator, which means that the particle is actually being destroyed. Similarly, when a particle is annihilated, its annihilation operator should be changed to the creation operator, which means that the particle is actually being created. This is the correct way to implement time reversal in quantum field theory, and it is essential to consider both the coordinate space and momentum space when calculating the creation and annihilation processes.

In addition, the time reversal operation should also be applied to the interaction Hamiltonian, which describes the interaction between particles. When the time reversal operation is applied to the interaction Hamiltonian, the creation and annihilation operators should be interchanged, which means that the interaction between particles should be reversed. This is because the time reversal operation should not only change the direction of time but also change the direction of the interaction between particles.

Furthermore, the time reversal operation should also be applied to the wave function of the system, which describes the quantum state of the system. When the time reversal operation is applied to the wave function, the creation and annihilation operators should be interchanged, which means that the quantum state of the system should be reversed. This is because the time reversal operation should not only change the direction of time but also change the quantum state of the system.

In conclusion, the time reversal operation in quantum field theory should be applied not only to the Hamiltonian of the coordinate space but also to the creation and annihilation processes, the interaction Hamiltonian, and the wave function of the system. This is because the time reversal operation should not only change the direction of time but also change the direction of the creation and annihilation processes, the interaction between particles, and the quantum state of the system."," creation operator after time reversal. It is proved that when the reversion of creation and annihilation processes is considered in momentum space, under the condition of high energy, a great symmetry violation of time reversal would be caused in some low order processes of electromagnetic interaction just as the Compton scattering in which the propagation lines of fermions are contained. This result contradicts with the experiments of particle physics and is impossible. Meanwhile, it is proved that the normalization processes of the third order vertex angles of electromagnetic interaction also violate time reversal symmetry, no matter in the coordinate space or in the momentum space. But the symmetry violation is small with a magnitude order about 10(-5). The similar problems exist in the current C transformation of quantum field theory. The C transformation of creation and annihilation operator can not be consistent with the C transformation of spinor particle's wave functions in momentum space. We can obtain the correct C transformation of creation and annihilation operator, but can not obtain the correct C transformation of wave functions in momentum space. Therefore, the current rules of C,T transformations in quantum field theory has serious defect and should be redefined."

So what you're saying is the upvote downvote system will take care of it and does take care of it on its own - in other words, the redidit system works as intended and the community determines what is or isn't interesting.

Who cares if someone submits a long video only to have it not be upvoted much? Why does it matter if there are long videos in general being submitted?

Its worth noting that moderators are here to merely moderate like in any forum -  no one regards them as good representatives of our collective interest in any sense. No one wants them assuming our opinion for us.

This result demonstrates the power of tree-walking-storage automata in processing and manipulating tree-like data structures. Furthermore, the study of these automata provides valuable insights into the fundamental limits of computation and the capabilities of finite-state devices.

In this context, it is also important to consider the computational complexity of tree-walking-storage automata, as they are often used in applications where efficiency is crucial. For instance, in the field of natural language processing, tree-walking-storage automata can be used to analyze and process complex sentence structures, such as those found in programming languages. In this scenario, the ability of tree-walking-storage automata to explore the interior of the tree storage and manipulate the tree-like data structure is particularly valuable."," unary languages as, for example, the language of words whose lengths are powers of two, or the language of words whose lengths are Fibonacci numbers. Comparing the computational capacities with automata from the classical automata hierarchy, we derive that the families of languages accepted by real-time deterministic (non-erasing) tree-walking-storage automata is located between the regular and the deterministic context-sensitive languages. There is a context-free language that is not accepted by any real-time deterministic tree-walking-storage automaton. On the other hand, these devices accept a unary language in non-erasing mode that cannot be accepted by any classical stack automaton, even in erasing mode and arbitrary time. Basic closure properties of the induced families of languages are shown. In particular, we consider Boolean operations (complementation, union, intersection) and AFL operations (union, intersection with regular languages, homomorphism, inverse homomorphism, concatenation, iteration). It turns out that the two families in question have the same properties and, in particular, share all but one of these closure properties with the important family of deterministic context-free languages."

In addition to its literal meaning, the term summit is often used figuratively to refer to a point of achievement or culmination, such as the summit of a career or the summit of a challenge. In this sense, a summit is a point of triumph and accomplishment, where one has reached the highest point of their abilities and has achieved a sense of fulfillment. The concept of a summit is also used in many other contexts, such as in business, politics, and education, where it refers to a point of convergence or a peak of achievement."," a line, trail, or route.
The highest summit in the world is Mount Everest with a height of 8,848.86 m (29,031.7 ft) above sea level. The first official ascent was made by Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary. They reached the mountain's peak in 1953.
Whether a highest point is classified as a summit, a sub peak or a separate mountain is subjective. The International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation's definition of a 4,000 m peak is that it has a prominence of 30 metres (98 ft) or more; it is a mountain summit if it has a prominence of at least 300 metres (980 ft).

These patterns, also known as Turing patterns, are characterized by the emergence of spatial structures, such as stripes, spirals, or spots, which are sustained by the interactions between the microtubules and the surrounding environment.

Furthermore, the study of microtubule self-organization has also been extended to other systems, such as bacterial colonies, where similar patterns have been observed. This has led to the development of new theories and models that aim to explain the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. For instance, the concept of ""swarm intelligence"" has been applied to the study of microtubule self-organization, which suggests that the collective behavior of individual microtubules can lead to the emergence of complex patterns and structures.

Moreover, the self-organizing behavior of microtubules has also been linked to various biological processes, such as cell migration, division, and differentiation. For example, the spatial self-organization of microtubules has been shown to play a crucial role in the formation of the spindle fibers during cell division. Additionally, the study of microtubule self-organization has also provided new insights into the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, where the disruption of microtubule dynamics has been implicated.

In conclusion, the study of microtubule self-organization has revealed a complex and fascinating world of collective dynamics and emergent phenomena, which has far-reaching implications for our understanding of biological systems and processes.

Nevertheless the question remains of whether microscopic tubulin trails produced by individual or bundles of several microtubules are intense enough to allow microtubule self-organization at a macroscopic level. In the present work, by simulating the diffusion of tubulin in microtubule solutions at the microscopic scale, we measure the shape and intensity of tubulin trails and discuss about the assumption of microtubule self-organization due to the production of chemical trails by disassembling microtubules. We show that the tubulin trails produced by individual microtubules or small microtubule arrays are very weak and not elongated even at very high reactive rates. Although the variations of concentration due to such trails are not significant compared to natural fluctuations of the concentration of tubuline in the chemical environment, the study shows that heterogeneities of biochemical composition can form due to microtubule disassembly. They could become significant when produced by numerous microtubule ends located in the same place. Their possible formation could play a role in certain conditions of reaction. In particular, it gives a mesoscopic basis to explain the collective dynamics observed in excitable microtubule solutions showing the propagation of concentration waves of microtubules at the millimeter scale, although we doubt that individual microtubules or bundles can behave like molecular ants."

The leading correction to the bosonized Hamiltonian can be written as a sum of two terms, each of which is proportional to the square of the boson field. The first term is a correction to the Gaussian approximation and arises from the finite curvature of the energy dispersion at the Fermi surface. The second term is a correction to the bosonized Hamiltonian due to around-the-corner processes. We show that this term is proportional to the product of the boson field and the derivative of the boson field.

The irreducible self-energy of the bosonic propagator is also affected by the around-the-corner processes. We derive an explicit expression for the self-energy, which is a function of the boson field and its derivative. The self-energy is shown to be proportional to the product of the boson field and the derivative of the boson field, similar to the correction to the bosonized Hamiltonian.

In the following, we will discuss the implications of our results for the properties of the bosonized system. The correction to the bosonized Hamiltonian and the self-energy due to around-the-corner processes can be used to calculate the physical properties of the system, such as the boson density of states and the boson propagator. We will also discuss the possibility of using our results to study the behavior of the bosonized system in different dimensions.",", we show that the self-energy correction to the Gaussian propagator is negligible if the dimensionless quantities $ ( \frac{q_{c} }{ k_{F}} )^d F_{0} [ 1 + F_{0} ]^{-1} \frac{\mu}{\nu^{\alpha}} | \frac{ \partial \nu^{\alpha} }{ \partial \mu} |$ are small compared with unity for all patches $\alpha$. Here $q_{c}$ is the cutoff of the interaction in wave-vector space, $k_{F}$ is the Fermi wave-vector, $\mu$ is the chemical potential, $F_{0}$ is the usual dimensionless Landau interaction-parameter, and $\nu^{\alpha} $ is the {\it{local}} density of states associated with patch $\alpha$. We also show that the well known cancellation between vertex- and self-energy corrections in one-dimensional systems, which is responsible for the fact that the random-phase approximation for the density-density correlation function is exact in $d=1$, exists also in $d> 1$, provided (1) the interaction cutoff $q_{c}$ is small compared with $k_{F}$, and (2) the energy dispersion is locally linearized at the Fermi the Fermi surface. Finally, we suggest a new systematic method to calculate corrections to the RPA, which is based on the perturbative calculation of the irreducible bosonic self-energy arising from the non-Gaussian terms of the bosonized Hamiltonian."

In this case, the infinitesimal generator $\Delta$T 1 is a densely defined closed operator on A, and the Arveson spectrum of (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1) is a compact subset of the complex plane. The function F (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1) can be defined as the holomorphic function on an open subset of C containing the Arveson spectrum of (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1) that satisfies certain properties.

For example, F (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1) can be defined as the holomorphic function that satisfies the following conditions:

1. F is holomorphic on an open subset of C containing the Arveson spectrum of (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1).
2. F has a zero at the origin.
3. F is continuous on the closure of the domain of holomorphy.

Using the theory of holomorphic functions, we can show that F (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1) can be extended to a holomorphic function on a larger open subset of C containing the Arveson spectrum of (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1). This extension can be obtained by using the theory of analytic continuation.

In the second class of semigroups, where T = (T ($\zeta$)) $\zeta$$\in$S a, the infinitesimal generator $\Delta$T 1 is a densely defined closed operator on A, and the Arveson spectrum of (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1) is a compact subset of the complex plane. The function F (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1) can be defined as the holomorphic function on an open subset of C containing the Arveson spectrum of (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1) that satisfies certain properties.

For example, F (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1) can be defined as the holomorphic function that satisfies the following conditions:

In both cases, the function F (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1) can be used to study the properties of the semigroup T = (T (te ia)t>0. For example, we can use F (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1) to study the convergence of the semigroup T = (T (te ia)t>0 to the identity operator on A. We can also use F (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1) to study the properties of the Arveson spectrum of (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1).

In conclusion, the function F (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1) provides a general framework for studying the properties of commuting one-parameter semigroups of multipliers on a commutative Banach algebra A. The function F (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1) can be used to study the properties of the semigroup T = (T (te ia)t>0 and the Arveson spectrum of (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1).",",b holomorphic on an open sector S a,b such that T ($\zeta$)A is dense in A for some, or equivalently for all $\zeta$ $\in$ S a,b. We use the notion of quasimultiplier, introduced in 1981 by the author at the Long Beach Conference on Banach algebras: the generators of the semigroups under consideration will be defined as quasimultipliers on A, and for $\zeta$ in the Arveson resolvent set $\sigma$ar($\Delta$T) the resolvent ($\Delta$T -- $\zeta$I) --1 will be defined as a regular quasimultiplier on A, i.e. a quasimultiplier S on A such that sup n$\ge$1 $\lambda$ n S n u < +$\infty$ for some $\lambda$ > 0 and some u generating a dense ideal of A and belonging to the intersection of the domains of S n , n $\ge$ 1. The first step consists in ""normalizing"" the Banach algebra A, i.e. continuously embedding A in a Banach algebra B having the same quasi-multiplier algebra as A but for which lim sup t$\rightarrow$0 + T (te ia) M(B) < +$\infty$ if T belongs to the class (1), and for which lim sup $\zeta$$\rightarrow$0 $\zeta$$\in$S $\alpha$,$\beta$ T ($\zeta$) < +$\infty$ for all pairs ($\alpha$, $\beta$) such that a < $\alpha$ < $\beta$ < b if T belongs to the class (2). Iterating this procedure this allows to consider ($\lambda$j$\Delta$T j + $\zeta$I) --1 as an element of M(B) for $\zeta$ $\in$ Resar(--$\lambda$j$\Delta$T j), the ""Arveson resolvent set "" of --$\lambda$j$\Delta$T j , and to use the standard integral 'resolvent formula' even if the given semigroups are not bounded near the origin. A first approach to the functional calculus involves the dual G a,b of an algebra of fast decreasing functions, described in Appendix 2. Let a = (a1,. .. , a k), b = (b1,. .. , b k), with aj $\le$ bj $\le$ aj + $\pi$, and denote by M a,b the set of families ($\alpha$, $\beta$) = ($\alpha$1, $\beta$1),. .. , ($\alpha$ k , $\beta$ k) such that 1"
sad,id1140,human," a controlled experiment with a group of participants who were asked to learn the software tool using either the video tutorial, the text tutorial, or a combination of both. The results showed that the participants who used the combination of both tutorials learned the software tool significantly faster and more efficiently than those who used only one type of tutorial. This suggests that combining different tutorial types can be an effective way to improve learning outcomes.

Furthermore, our study also found that the type of tutorial used had a significant impact on the participants' perceived learning experience. Those who used the video tutorial reported a higher level of engagement and motivation compared to those who used the text tutorial. On the other hand, those who used the text tutorial reported a higher level of control and flexibility in their learning process. These findings suggest that different tutorial types may be more suitable for different learning styles and preferences.

In addition, our study also explored the role of prior knowledge and experience in the learning process. We found that participants with prior experience in programming learned the software tool faster and more efficiently than those without prior experience. This suggests that prior knowledge and experience can be an important factor in determining the effectiveness of a tutorial.

Overall, our study provides insights into the effectiveness of different tutorial types and the role of prior knowledge and experience in the learning process. The findings suggest that combining different tutorial types and taking into account the learners' prior knowledge and experience can be an effective way to improve learning outcomes. Future studies could further explore these findings and investigate the role of other factors, such as learner motivation and cognitive style, in the learning process."," an experiment in three groups where 42 undergraduate students from a software engineering course were commissioned to operate the software tool after using a tutorial: the first group was provided only with the video tutorial, the second group only with the text tutorial and the third group with both. In this context, the differences in terms of efficiency were almost negligible: We could observe that participants using only the text tutorial completed the tutorial faster than the participants with the video tutorial. However, the participants using only the video tutorial applied the learned content faster, achieving roughly the same bottom line performance. We also found that if both tutorial types are offered, participants prefer video tutorials for learning new content but text tutorials for looking up ""missed"" information. We mainly gathered our data through questionnaires and screen recordings and analyzed it with suitable statistical hypotheses tests. The data is available at [12]. Since producing tutorials requires effort, knowing with which type of tutorial learnability can be increased to which extent has an immense practical relevance. We conclude that in contexts similar to ours, while it would be ideal if software tool makers would offer both tutorial types, it seems more efficient to produce only text tutorials instead of a passive video tutorial - provided you manage to motivate your learners to use them."

10) Prioritize your mental health. College can be stressful, so make sure to take breaks, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep.

Some additional tips specifically for managing money and food in college:

11) Use a debit card instead of a credit card to avoid overspending and accumulating debt.
12) Take advantage of campus dining plans or meal swipes to save money on food.
13) Shop at discount stores or dollar stores for non-perishable items.
14) Use coupons or sign up for rewards programs at your favorite restaurants or stores.
15) Consider meal planning with friends to split costs and try new recipes.

Remember, college is a time for learning and growth, both academically and personally. By staying organized, managing your finances, and taking care of yourself, you can make the most of your college experience. Good luck!"," bill, internet and cable(if), food, etc.
3)Ride a bike and save on gas. 
4)DO NOT PARTY. Spend 98% of your time investing in your education and your skill set. Review your notes. Volunteer somewhere. Get a part time job even if you don't need the money. Read a book(there's hundreds of thousands of books out there, focus on self-help books, bibliographies and memoirs)
5)Read anything that's not on your screen for God's sake!
6)Go into your professor's office hours, become friends with your professors and staff. Especially your school's librarian.
7)Prepare meals for the next 3 to 6 days. Step1: Make a huge batch of food balancing your protein, carbs, and veggies. Step2: Separate in portions in Ziploc or Tupperware containers and store it in your fridge or freezer. Step 3: Reheat your food in the microwave and voila. Usually the process of making all this food will take about 2-3 hours. But it will save you A LOT of time during the week that you could be spending doing homework, studying or napping. Also, you can make this into a really low budget yet healthy and delicious meals. 
8)Choose to change sleeping cycle from a monophasic to a polyphasic sleeping cycle. Trust me, there's nothing than feeling fully awake ALL DAY LONG. There's different sleeping cycles and they will help A LOT for your brain's memory capacity.
9)Take cold showers. There's just too many physical and psychological benefits from them to even mention in here.

ehhddieeee: I can't ignore the fact that your opinio is generic, biased, and extremely skewed.
Yes, there's polyphasic sleeping cycles that are crazy that require you to sleep 20 minutes every 2 hours. But there's also sleeping cycles that are very easy to maintain and that a matter of fact many people use including people you know e.g. the siesta cycle (sleep 5-6 hours at night with a nap 6 hours after you woke up from 20-90 minutes long), there's one called segmented, it's my personal favorite i sleep for three hours wake up for two hours usually to read, tidy up my house, and meditate. Then go back to sleep.

To further demonstrate the feasibility of this design, we have developed a computational model that simulates the behavior of the DNA strands and the resulting Boolean circuit. Our simulations show that the circuit is able to accurately process input signals and produce the correct output signals, even in the presence of noise and imperfections in the DNA strands. This suggests that the design could be experimentally implemented using existing DNA-based technologies, such as DNA microarrays or DNA sequencing platforms.

One potential application of this design is in the development of novel biosensors that can detect specific biomarkers in biological samples. By designing a Boolean circuit that incorporates DNA strands specific to the biomarker of interest, it may be possible to create a sensor that can accurately detect and quantify the biomarker in real-time. This could have significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, as well as for the development of personalized medicine.

Another potential application of this design is in the development of novel DNA-based computing architectures. By using DNA strands to represent Boolean values and constructing DNA-based gates that perform logical operations, it may be possible to create a DNA-based computer that is capable of processing complex computations and solving complex problems. This could have significant implications for fields such as cryptography, data compression, and artificial intelligence.

Overall, our novel theoretical biomolecular design for implementing Boolean circuits using DNA strand displacement has the potential to revolutionize the field of biomolecular computing and open up new possibilities for the development of novel biosensors and DNA-based computing architectures."," can be distributed to each wire in the circuit to overcome signal degradation. This means we can achieve a digital abstraction of the analog values of concentrations. Finally, the design is energy-efficient: if input species are specified ideally (meaning absolutely 0 concentration of unwanted species), then output species converge to their ideal concentrations at steady-state, and the system at steady-state is in (dynamic) equilibrium, meaning that no energy is consumed by irreversible reactions until the input again changes. Drawbacks of our design include the following. If input is provided non-ideally (small positive concentration of unwanted species), then energy must be continually expended to maintain correct output concentrations even at steady-state. In addition, our fuel species - those species that are permanently consumed in irreversible reactions - are not ""generic""; each gate in the circuit is powered by its own specific type of fuel species. Hence different circuits must be powered by different types of fuel. Finally, we require input to be given according to the dual-rail convention, so that an input of 0 is specified not only by the absence of a certain species, but by the presence of another. That is, we do not construct a ""true NOT gate"" that sets its output to high concentration if and only if its input's concentration is low. It remains an open problem to design scalable, time-responsive, digital, energy-efficient molecular circuits that additionally solve one of these problems, or to prove that some subset of their resolutions are mutually incompatible."

In this context, the concept of p-rationality is crucial in number theory, as it provides a way to classify number fields based on their arithmetic properties. The ray class group modulo p 2 (resp. 8) is a fundamental invariant of a number field, and its characterization of p-rationality is a significant result in this area. The PARI Programs provided in this paper offer a practical tool for testing p-rationality, making it easier for researchers to explore this concept.

The analysis of quadratic fields and their p-rationality is also an important aspect of this paper. The densities related to Cohen-Lenstra-Martinet ones and the Greenberg's conjecture on the existence of p-rational fields with Galois groups (Z/2Z) t provide valuable insights into the properties of these fields. The examples given for p = 3, t = 5 and t = 6 demonstrate the practical applications of these concepts.

Furthermore, the paper also touches on the concept of imaginary quadratic fields, which are p-rational for all p $\ge$ 2. This result, attributed to Angelakis-Stevenhagen, highlights the importance of p-rationality in number theory. The concept of p-rationality has far-reaching implications in many areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, number theory, and arithmetic geometry.

In conclusion, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of p-rationality and its applications in number theory.

sad,id150,human," generations are shaped by the experiences and values of their predecessors, and as a result, the cycle continues.

This cycle of crisis and recovery is thought to have occurred throughout American history, with each saeculum bringing about a new era of growth, prosperity, and societal change. For example, the American Revolution marked the beginning of a new saeculum, which was followed by a period of growth and expansion during the 19th century. The Civil War and Reconstruction marked the beginning of a new turning, which was followed by a period of industrialization and urbanization during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Great Depression and World War II marked the beginning of a new saeculum, which was followed by a period of post-war prosperity and social change during the 1950s and 1960s.

The Strauss–Howe theory also suggests that each generation has its own unique characteristics and values, which are shaped by the historical events and cultural trends of their time. For example, the GI Generation, born during the 1920s and 1930s, was shaped by the Great Depression and World War II, and as a result, they were known for their sense of duty, loyalty, and patriotism. The Baby Boomers, born during the 1940s and 1950s, were shaped by the post-war prosperity and social change of the 1960s, and as a result, they were known for their optimism, idealism, and activism. The Millennial Generation, born during the 1980s and 1990s, was shaped by the technological advancements and global events of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and as a result, they are known for their tech-savviness, diversity, and social responsibility.

The Strauss–Howe theory has been widely applied in fields such as history, sociology, and psychology, and has been used to explain many of the events and trends of the past century. While some critics have questioned the theory's accuracy and predictive power, it remains a widely-discussed and influential framework for understanding the cyclical nature of human history and the impact of historical events on individual generations."," generational archetypes attack and weaken institutions in the name of autonomy and individualism, which eventually creates a tumultuous political environment that ripens conditions for another crisis.
Strauss and Howe laid the groundwork for their theory in their book Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069 (1991), which discusses the history of the United States as a series of generational biographies going back to 1584. In their book The Fourth Turning (1997), the authors expanded the theory to focus on a fourfold cycle of generational types and recurring mood eras to describe the history of the United States, including the Thirteen Colonies and their British antecedents. However, the authors have also examined generational trends elsewhere in the world and described similar cycles in several developed countries.
Academic response to the theory has been mixed, with some applauding Strauss and Howe for their ""bold and imaginative thesis"", while others have criticized the theory as being overly deterministic, unfalsifiable, and unsupported by rigorous evidence. Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who graduated from Harvard University with Strauss, called Generations the most stimulating book on American history he'd ever read, and even sent a copy to each member of Congress. The theory has been influential in the fields of generational studies, marketing, and business management literature. However, the theory has also been described by some historians and journalists as pseudoscientific, ""kooky"", and ""an elaborate historical horoscope that will never withstand scholarly scrutiny"". Academic criticism has focused on the lack of rigorous empirical evidence for their claims, as well as the authors' view that generational groupings are more powerful than other social groupings, such as economic class, race, sex, religion, and political parties."

And then, when I saw the group chat blowing up with party plans and celebrations, it hit me like a ton of bricks - I was no longer part of the group, and they had moved on without me.

I felt a mix of emotions - hurt, anger, and embarrassment. I didn't know how to process it, and I didn't know how to react. I didn't want to reach out to them and ask why I wasn't invited, because that would mean admitting that I cared, and I didn't want to be vulnerable like that. But at the same time, I couldn't help but wonder if it was because of my age, or because I'm a guy, or because I'm just not ""cool"" enough. I felt like I was stuck in this limbo, unsure of how to move forward.

As the days went by, I found myself avoiding the group chat, not wanting to see the happy memories they were making without me. I started to question my own identity and worth, wondering if I was just a temporary placeholder in their lives, someone they tolerated because I was a colleague, but not someone they actually considered a friend. The more I thought about it, the more it ate away at me, and I found myself withdrawing from my colleagues, not wanting to face the possibility that I was just a ghost to them.

I know it sounds silly, but as a nurse, I'm used to being in control, to being the one who takes care of others, not the one who's left behind. And the feeling of being left behind, of being invisible, was suffocating me. I didn't know how to break free from it, and I didn't know how to make it stop. All I knew was that I needed to get out of that group chat, and I needed to find a way to move on from the pain and the hurt."," no body seemed to care.

Since I'm still part of the snapchat group chat, I open it up last night and I see the PA is there hanging out with all the girls, doing shots and not that this crushed me, but I do feel like I wasn't very well liked at all. I come to visit the unit sometimes and all the girls freak out! OMG we miss you! They'll say but I just dont feel this is true at all. I try to brush it off as the story of my life or that I'm being to sensitive about nothing as usual but I can't shake the feeling. I have a limited number of friends as it is that I may see a couple times a year, and because I work in nursing I feel  making new friends is even more difficult. One girl must have seen I was on the group chat and facetimed me on the spot which I rejected because I was just sitting on the couch with my girlfriend at 10pm. I guess that means something? I don't know but I have no one to really talk about this with so I'm leaving it here. I'm just feeling more and more like I should go back to therapy even though I never felt it was very worth it before maybe I could use it now.

One of the main concerns I have is that BWF may not be as effective for building muscle mass as traditional weightlifting. I've heard that the lack of progressive overload, or increasing the weight or resistance over time, can lead to plateaus and stagnation in muscle growth. This is a concern for me because I'm looking to continue improving my strength and muscle mass over time.

Another concern I have is that BWF may not be as effective for building functional strength as traditional weightlifting. I've heard that traditional weightlifting exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench press are more effective for building strength that can be transferred to real-life situations. This is a concern for me because I'm a martial artist and I need to be able to apply my strength in a functional way.

Despite these concerns, I'm still interested in trying BWF and seeing if it can help me achieve my goals. I'm willing to put in the work and make adjustments as needed to ensure that I'm getting the most out of my training. I'm also open to trying different variations of BWF, such as incorporating weighted exercises or using resistance bands, to see if they can help me achieve my goals.

I eat pretty healthy foods, staying around 2400-2800 calories a day, except on my yoga days where it's closer to 2200. I'm a vegetarian so I don't get as much protein as most might from their food, but it's pretty adequate, plus I do drink a protein shake daily. I eat mostly fruits and veggies, quinoa, some veggie burgers (shit's expensive, yo), peanut butter, and oatmeal. Soda maybe once or twice per year, chips and crappy snacks maybe once a month. 

My question is, will bodyweight fitness put on a lot of muscle? How hard can I expect to plateau, eventually (I'm no stranger to plateaus, they happen quite frequently in jiu jitsu and I've seen them mentioned a bit here)? Anyone else in the same, or a similar, boat?
ADDSail: It doesn't put on as much muscle as lifting weights would in the same amount of time. You will for sure get stronger and depending on your diet, get bigger if you eat above your TDEE. You can make sure you gain minimal size by controlling your diet and (arguably) staying in strength related rep ranges of 3-5 reps per set. 

As for plateaus, with proper training, diet, consistency and patience you can bust out of them pretty quickly. Obviously skills like the planche may not include measurable progress every session. If you're just starting plateaus are not something to worry about. Given perfect circumstances, strength will go up every 1-2-3 workouts for a long time. 

Great idea to supplement BJJ with BWF. I casually rolled with a V10 level rock climber once and the grip strength was on another level. Inescapable wrist control, even when sweaty. 
eman_resu_tluafed: I go back and forth between deficit and surplus every day or so. I mostly go for maintenance but I have cut out some cardio and circuit training to be able to do BWF. 

On another note, one of the guys I trained with at my old gym was a rock concert and former stone mason. His collar grips were unbreakable. 
ADDSail: Yeah day to day variance is fine. If you don't want to cut cardio and circuit training you can just eat a little bit more. But if you're rolling every day you probably don't need too much supplementary conditioning. I always think it's insane how 45 minutes jogging on a treadmill doesn't even add up to a Big Mac calorie-wise. 

Gi? Booo. 
eman_resu_tluafed: Don't like the gi?

As the debate continues, it's clear that the concept of waiving rights is a complex and nuanced issue. While some argue that a waiver can provide a sense of security for both the business and the individual, others point out that it's not a foolproof solution. The risk of a judge rejecting the waiver is always present, and the consequences can be severe.

In the United States, the concept of inalienable rights is rooted in the country's founding documents, including the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. These rights are considered fundamental and cannot be taken away by any government or institution. However, as flamingfireworks noted, the interpretation of these rights is often left to the discretion of the courts.

This raises important questions about the role of judges in shaping the law. While judges are trained to interpret the law and make decisions based on the facts of a case, their personal biases and perspectives can sometimes influence their decisions. This is particularly true when it comes to complex issues like waivers, where the outcome can have significant consequences for all parties involved.

In the context of Ms. Kobayashi's restaurant, the use of waivers may provide a sense of security for both the business and the individual. However, it's important to recognize that this approach is not without its risks. If a judge were to reject the waiver, the consequences could be severe, potentially leaving the business and individual vulnerable to liability.

As the debate continues, it's clear that there is no easy solution to this complex issue. While waivers may provide a sense of security, they are not a foolproof solution. The key to navigating this issue is to understand the risks and consequences involved, and to approach the situation with caution and respect for the law.

In the end, the use of waivers in Ms. Kobayashi's restaurant is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. While it may provide a sense of security for both the business and the individual, it's important to recognize the risks and consequences involved. By understanding the nuances of this issue, we can work towards finding a solution that balances the needs of all parties involved.

In the meantime, Ms. Kobayashi's restaurant remains a beacon of hope for those struggling to make ends meet. Her willingness to provide a meal to anyone who is willing to work for it is a testament to her compassion and commitment to her community. As the debate continues, it's clear that her restaurant is more than just a place to eat - it's a symbol of the power of human connection and the importance of treating others with dignity and respect."," interpretation of the constitution.

Which means a judge could say that a TOS or a contract that says ""if you install this app, anything you ever do on your phone is now our IP"" or """" if you work for me, I am not responsible for anything that happens to you regardless of any circumstances surrounding it"" is invalid
generalnotsew: Thing is a waiver will not protect you from a person doing something grossly negligent.  Run a russian roulette game and you will be in trouble.  
flamingfireworks: yes, that is literally what i just said. Waivers mean jack shit in court if you dont have the best lawyer there is, and at best the waiver is just evidence that you both knew there's an inherent risk to the action, which can work against the person being sued.
nicklesismoneyto: But isn't signing the waiver that person completely accepting that risk as their responsibility? I'm asking sincerely because I didn't know waivers could be tossed so easily. I'm having trouble understanding how someone accepting a risk can come back on someone else.
flamingfireworks: eh, not really.

For one, (depending on the lawyer, county, etc) it can be argued the waiver is signed under duress or unfair circumstances. In this case, it wouldnt be too hard to say ""the guy was given a choice to sign his name on a piece of paper or starve that day"" to get the judge to agree that the waiver aint shit.

For two, to prevent people from just throwing around ""if you enter my property and sign this waiver, you cant sue me for anything"" contracts and then not doing anything to ensure safety in the property or just straightup forcing people to do unsafe shit, part of what a judge and jury is responsible for is to look at the waiver and the circumstances and conditions of the incident and decide if the waiver is something written in bad faith, pretty much, or if its still *clearly* not the injured person's fault. So like, if im running a business, and i hire you, make you sign the waiver, and then i say ""go over there, take the fries out of the fryer"", but i had neglected to maintain it properly, and as you get there, the oil sprays out and melts your face or some shit, and you sued me, the judge would take one look at it and decide ""yeah, this is most definitely not the injured person's fault"" and throw the waiver out

3. IIRC, i could be wrong, but unless its notarized contracts *really* aint shit.

Thats why even if you go to a zoo and you sign the ""i know i can get fucked up if i act like my heads up my ass"" contract, they still have fences and personnel on scene to make sure that you dont act like a headass and get seriously injured.
nicklesismoneyto: Ok this makes more sense. Thank you for the explanation.

The FC curves show a different behavior, with a more gradual decrease in magnetization with temperature, especially for the OA samples. The ac magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal a peak in the imaginary part of the susceptibility χ'' at TB, which is related to the blocking temperature of the NP. The results suggest that the NP are superparamagnetic at high temperatures and exhibit a blocked magnetic state at lower temperatures.

The blocking temperature TB is a critical parameter in the study of magnetic NP, as it determines the temperature range where the NP exhibit a blocked magnetic state. The temperature range where the NP are blocked can be controlled by adjusting the NP coating, magnetite concentration, and external magnetic field. The blocked state is characterized by a decrease in magnetization with temperature, which is a result of the thermal activation of the NP. The blocked state is important for many applications, including magnetic storage, magnetic resonance imaging, and biomedicine.

The results of this study demonstrate the importance of understanding the magnetic properties of NP, particularly the blocking temperature, in order to optimize their performance in various applications. The ability to control the blocking temperature through the NP coating and magnetite concentration opens up new possibilities for the design of NP with specific magnetic properties. Future studies can focus on the development of NP with tailored magnetic properties for specific applications, such as magnetic hyperthermia, magnetic targeting, and magnetic imaging."," increasing H and, for a given H, the increase in the magnetite concentration results in an increase of TB. The observed behavior is related to the dipolar interaction (DI) between NP which seems to be an important mechanism in all samples studied. This is supported by the results of the ac magnetic susceptibility Xac measurements, where the temperature in which X' peaks for different frequencies follows the Vogel-Fulcher model, a feature commonly found in systems with dipolar interactions. Curves of H vs. TB/TB(H=0) for samples with different coatings and magnetite concentrations collapse into a universal curve, indicating that the qualitative magnetic behavior of the samples may be described by the NP themselves, instead of the coating or the strength of the dipolar interaction. Below TB, M vs. H curves show a coercive field (HC) that increases monotonically with decreasing temperature. The saturation magnetization (MS) follows the Bloch's law and values of MS at room temperature as high as 78 emu/g were estimated, a result corresponding to ~80% of the bulk value. The overlap of M/MS vs. H/T curves for a given sample and the low HC at high temperatures suggest superparamagnetic behavior in all samples studied. The overlap of M/MS vs. H curves at constant temperature for different samples indicates that the NP magnetization behavior is preserved, independently of the coating and magnetite concentration."
sad,id1572,human," that most people who travel don't really experience the authentic local culture. They just get a watered-down version of it.

But what about those who venture off the beaten path? What about those who are willing to take the risk and immerse themselves in the unknown? They're the ones who truly experience the fascination of traveling. They're the ones who discover hidden gems, who stumble upon secret spots, and who form deep connections with the people they meet along the way.

These travelers are the ones who venture into the heart of the city, who explore the winding streets and alleys, who visit the local markets and try the street food. They're the ones who take the time to learn a few key phrases in the local language, who make an effort to understand the customs and traditions of the place they're visiting. They're the ones who stay in small, family-run guesthouses, who eat at local eateries, and who drink at hole-in-the-wall bars.

And it's these travelers who truly experience the fascination of traveling. They're the ones who are open to new experiences, who are willing to take the leap and try something new. They're the ones who are curious about the world and its many wonders. They're the ones who are fascinated by the unknown, who are drawn to the mystery and the intrigue of it all.

But even for these travelers, there's a limit to how much they can truly experience the local culture. There's only so much they can learn, only so much they can see and do. And eventually, they'll have to leave, to return to their own world, to share their stories and memories with others.

And that's when the fascination of traveling really sets in. It's not just about the places you visit, it's not just about the things you see and do. It's about the people you meet, the connections you form, and the memories you make along the way. It's about the way traveling changes you, the way it broadens your perspective, and the way it makes you see the world in a new and different light.

So, what's the fascination of traveling? It's not just about the places you visit, it's about the experiences you have, the people you meet, and the memories you make along the way. It's about the way traveling changes you, and the way it makes you see the world in a new and different light."," that the waitstaff serving American tourists has probably done more to adapt to the tourists than the tourists have to adapt to them.  They learned English, they learned about what you expect in a dining experience, they know how Americans like their food, they know what music American tourists expect in their shops.  

The real point of travel is to have fun and see something different.  
HridaySabz: First off, adapted cuisine is nowhere near the authentic food you get to taste when you travel. You think the ""Indian"" food you get to taste in the States is anywhere near what you have in India? 

Also, your reference to ""large modern cities"", the blog doesn't even talk about the fact that you need to learn a new language. It talks about how being in a foreign land, you get to experience things differently, as in the sights and sounds etc. Most real travellers (not the Instagram ""travelholics"") want to experience new things, and many backpackers opt to stay in smaller, less frequented places as a result.

It also makes reference to the fact that people travel to escape work. Don't think so? Ask a 9 to 5 working individual and offer them a two week no work vacation, see how quickly they take it.

""Load of bunk"" is ironically the same phrase that can be used to describe your 'fine criticisms' of this blog.
Palentir: Yes it's locally made, I'm not disputing locally made.  I'm disputing that the recipe used isn't tweaked to American tastes.  If you eat local food in a rural village that doesn't get a lot of tourists, sure, it's probably authentic.  If you went to a local tourist spot in downtown Dehli, you might think it's authentic, but it's geared to tourists who come to India to see ""authentic "" Indian culture and eat authentic Indian food while ignoring that they are doing so in a place that makes millions of dollars in the tourism business and know how to cater to American adventure seekers.  Tourism is a major industry.  

And as I said, most of the tourists I know who visit other countries are doing exactly that.  They go to Cancun or Puerta Vallarta, San Juan, or Tokyo or Seoul.  Places that every American visiting those countries goes to.  Many of them never leave the downtown area for more than a day.  So you essentially see the Disney version of those cultures where it's all made to look unique while being completely chewed on to not offend American sensibility or tastebuds.  If you want authentic, go to Rural Mexico where you'll be one of the only Americans there.  Go to rural Japan or Korea for that matter.

sad,id1138,human," is based on a modular architecture, which allows for the easy addition of new languages and features. The system consists of a core interpreter, a set of language-specific modules, and a MOP that provides a uniform interface to the interpreter and the language-specific modules.

The core interpreter is responsible for executing the program, while the language-specific modules provide the necessary functionality for the specific language. The MOP acts as a bridge between the core interpreter and the language-specific modules, allowing for the dynamic adaptation of the interpreter's behavior. The MOP provides a set of methods that can be used to manipulate the interpreter's state, such as setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting the call stack.

The language-specific modules are responsible for implementing the language-specific semantics, such as parsing, lexical analysis, and syntax analysis. The MOP provides a set of interfaces that the language-specific modules can use to interact with the core interpreter, such as setting the program counter, getting the current instruction, and setting the return value.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, we implemented a prototype interpreter for the language Python. The prototype interpreter is able to execute Python programs and provide a set of debugging tools, such as setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting the call stack. The prototype interpreter is also able to dynamically adapt to the task at hand, such as by setting the program counter to a specific location in the code.

In conclusion, our system provides a framework-level MOP that supports open programming language interpreters. The system is modular, allowing for the easy addition of new languages and features. The MOP provides a uniform interface to the interpreter and the language-specific modules, allowing for dynamic adaptation of the interpreter's behavior. We believe that our system has the potential to revolutionize the field of programming language interpretation, by providing a flexible and extensible framework for building interpreters."," implementation is integrated in the Neverlang framework. The system exposes the structure, behavior and the runtime state of any Neverlang-based interpreter with the ability to modify it. Knowledge: Our system provides a complete control over interpreter's structure, behavior and its runtime state. The approach is applicable to every Neverlang-based interpreter. Adaptation code can potentially be reused across different language implementations. Grounding: Having a prototype implementation we focused on feasibility evaluation. The paper shows that our approach well addresses problems commonly found in the research literature. We have a demonstrative video and examples that illustrate our approach on dynamic software adaptation, aspect-oriented programming, debugging and context-aware interpreters. Importance: To our knowledge, our paper presents the first reflective approach targeting a general framework for language development. Our system provides full reflective support for free to any Neverlang-based interpreter. We are not aware of any prior application of open implementations to programming language interpreters in the sense defined in this paper. Rather than substituting other approaches, we believe our system can be used as a complementary technique in situations where other approaches present serious limitations."

As the years went by, the organization expanded its scope and mission, embracing a broader vision of social and economic justice. It became a powerful force in the labor movement, advocating for workers' rights and challenging the exploitation of the working class. The Workmen's Circle also played a significant role in promoting Yiddish language and culture, recognizing the importance of preserving the cultural heritage of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe.

Today, The Workers Circle continues to be a vibrant and dynamic organization, with a wide range of programs and activities that promote social justice, Jewish community and education. Its schools and Yiddish education programs are renowned for their excellence, and its concerts, lectures and secular holiday celebrations are highly acclaimed. The organization's community branch offices throughout North America provide a vital link between the organization and its members, offering a range of services and programs that promote social and economic justice.

Soon, the organization was joined by more politically focused socialist Bundists who advocated the anti-assimilationist idea of Yiddish cultural autonomy, led by education in Yiddish and socialist ideals. The Circle formed the Folksbiene Yiddish theatre troupe and promoted Jewish arts and music, Yiddish school programs for children and Yiddish summer camps. It became influential in the American labor movement and grew to serve more than 84,000 members through hundreds of branches around North America. It also became involved with the Yiddish newspaper The Forward and operated old-age homes, medical clinics and other services.
Politically, the Circle moved away from socialism towards liberalism by the time of the New Deal. By the 1960s, the Circle's membership began to decline, as Jews joined the middle class and moved from cities to suburbs; the Circle no longer seemed as essential to many as it had been. In the new century, the organization ended its direct health insurance program, streamlined its operations, separated from The Forward, and rededicated its mission to education and promoting Jewish community, secular Yiddish culture and social justice activism.

In this context, we also explore the connection between the moment problem and the concept of optimal transport, which has been extensively studied in the literature. The optimal transport problem is a fundamental problem in mathematics and has numerous applications in various fields such as economics, physics, and computer science. The problem is to find the optimal way to transport a given measure from a source to a target, while minimizing a certain cost function. The moment problem can be viewed as a special case of the optimal transport problem, where the cost function is the moment sequence of the measure.

Furthermore, we also discuss the implications of our results on the problem of density estimation, which is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning. The problem is to estimate the density of a given probability measure from a set of samples. Our results show that the sole knowledge of first degree moments of the function is sufficient to obtain asymptotically all the other moments, which can be used to estimate the density of the measure. This has important implications for various applications such as signal processing, image analysis, and data analysis.

In addition, we also explore the connection between the moment problem and the concept of sparsity, which has been extensively studied in the literature. The concept of sparsity refers to the idea that many signals and data sets have a sparse representation, meaning that they can be represented by a small number of non-zero coefficients. Our results show that the sparsity inducing criterion related to the weighted 1-norm of the moment sequence of the measure is sufficient to obtain the optimal solution of the moment problem. This has important implications for various applications such as compressed sensing, sparse coding, and machine learning.

Finally, we also discuss the implications of our results on the problem of moment matrix completion, which is a fundamental problem in linear algebra and has numerous applications in various fields such as signal processing, control theory, and machine learning. The problem is to complete a given moment matrix, which is a matrix whose entries are the moments of a given measure, while minimizing a certain cost function. Our results show that the sole knowledge of first degree moments of the function is sufficient to obtain asymptotically all the other moments, which can be used to complete the moment matrix. This has important implications for various applications such as signal processing, control theory, and machine learning.

In conclusion, our results show that the sole knowledge of first degree moments of the function is sufficient to obtain asymptotically all the other moments by solving a hierarchy of semidefinite relax-ations with a specific sparsity inducing criterion related to a weighted 1-norm of the moment sequence of the measure. This has important implications for various applications such as optimal transport, density estimation, sparsity, and moment matrix completion."," (LP). Then one may recover the function by a recent extraction algorithm based on the Christoffel-Darboux kernel associated with the measure. Finally, the support of such a measure supported on a graph is a meager, very thin (hence sparse) set. Therefore the LP on measures with this sparsity inducing criterion can be interpreted as an analogue for infinite-dimensional signals of the LP in super-resolution for (sparse) atomic signals. In data science, it is often relevant to process moments of a signal instead of the signal itself. For complex valued signals, the moments are Fourier coefficients, and many filtering operations are efficiently carried out in the sequence of moments. In numerical approximation algorithms, many operations on real valued signals are more efficiently implemented in their sequence of Chebyshev coefficients [19]. In the moment-SOS hierarchy approach, many nonlinear nonconvex problems are reformulated and solved approximately in the sequence of moments; see [13, 12] and references therein. Once moments or approximate moments have been computed, one is faced with the inverse problem of reconstructing the signal from its moments. The recent work [15] describes an algorithm based on the Christoffel-Darboux kernel, to recover the graph of a function from knowledge of its moments. Its novelty (and distinguishing feature) is to approximate the graph of the function (rather than the function itself) with a semialgebraic function (namely a minimizer of a sum of squares of polynomials) with L 1 and pointwise convergence guarantees for an increasing number of input moments.

The second analysis is a search for sterile neutrinos in the context of the Daya Bay experiment. We use the Daya Bay data to constrain the sterile neutrino mixing angle, and find that the results are consistent with the global fit. This analysis provides further evidence for the existence of sterile neutrinos and demonstrates the potential of the Daya Bay experiment to make precise measurements of sterile neutrino properties.

The existence of sterile neutrinos would have significant implications for our understanding of the universe. It would suggest that there are additional particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, which could provide a new window into the early universe and the origins of matter and energy. The discovery of sterile neutrinos would also have significant implications for our understanding of the neutrino mass hierarchy and the mechanism of neutrino oscillations.

In addition to the sterile neutrino analyses, we also present a new method for reconstructing the neutrino energy spectrum in the Daya Bay experiment. This method uses a neural network to classify events based on their energy and angular distributions, and has been shown to improve the accuracy of the neutrino energy spectrum reconstruction. This method has the potential to be used in future neutrino experiments, and could provide a new tool for studying the properties of neutrinos.

Overall, this thesis presents two new analyses of sterile neutrino data and a new method for reconstructing the neutrino energy spectrum. These results demonstrate the potential of the Daya Bay experiment to make precise measurements of sterile neutrino properties and provide a new window into the early universe and the origins of matter and energy."," global data set compared to the null, with an improvement of $\Delta \chi^2 = 51$ with the addition of only 3 degrees of freedom, corresponding to $6.6\sigma$. While a substantial improvement, we also find a irreconcilable tension between the data sets of $5.1\sigma$, calculated using the parameter goodness-of-fit test. This motivates the exploration of expanded models: a 3+2 model, and a 3+1+Decay model. In the 3+2 model, we find negligible improvement to the fit, and an even worse tension of $5.5\sigma$. In the more exotic 3+1+Decay model, we find the tension reduced to $3.6\sigma$. While a substantial improvement compared to the 3+1 model with the introduction of only one additional parameter, the tension is still too large to assuage concerns. The second analysis is the results of an expanded IceCube sterile neutrino search. A previous sterile neutrino search found no evidence for sterile neutrinos, finding a p-value of 8%. Of the three sterile mixing angles, $\theta_{14}, \theta_{24}$, and $\theta_{34}$, only $\theta_{24}$ was fitted for, as $\theta_{14}$ was negligible and $\theta_{34} = 0$ was considered a conservative assumption. We present results of an analysis where we include $\theta_{34}$ to the fitted model. Both a frequentist and Bayesian analysis were conducted, with fits done in terms of the mass-squared splitting $\Delta m_{41}^2$ and the mixing matrix parameters $|U_{\mu4}|^2$ and $|U_{\tau4}|^2$. The frequentist analysis finds a best fit at $\Delta m_{41}^2 = 5.0\ \textrm{eV}^2$, $|U_{\mu4}|^2 = 0.04$, and $|U_{\tau4}|^2 = 0.006$, with a p-value of 5.2% assuming Wilks' Theorem with 3 degrees of freedom. Pseudoexperiments are indicating a smaller p-value 2.7%. The Bayesian analysis finds a similar best fit point at $\Delta m_{41}^2 = 5.0\ \textrm{eV}^2$, $|U_{\mu4}|^2 = 0.02$, and $|U_{\tau4}|^2 = 0.006$, with a Bayes factor indicating a ``Very Strong'' preference for this sterile hypothesis over the null hypothesis."
sad,id1189,human," examples of such optimization problems include the Lasso, the Dantzig selector, and the basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) algorithm. These methods have been widely applied in various fields, including image and signal processing, machine learning, and statistics.

In recent years, a third route has emerged, which combines elements from both Bayesian and sparse regularization approaches. This route relies on the use of non-convex optimization problems, often involving non-smooth penalty terms, to promote specific structures in the unknowns. Examples of such methods include the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm, which is used in total variation (TV) regularization, and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which is used in various applications, including image deblurring and compressive sensing. These methods have been shown to be effective in solving a wide range of inverse problems, including those with non-Gaussian noise and non-linear dependencies between the unknowns and the observed data.

Another important aspect of inverse problems is the issue of computational efficiency. Inverse problems often require solving large-scale optimization problems, which can be computationally demanding. To address this issue, various techniques have been developed, including parallel computing, GPU acceleration, and approximation methods. For example, the use of parallel computing can significantly reduce the computational time required to solve large-scale optimization problems, while the use of GPU acceleration can further improve the efficiency of the algorithms. Approximation methods, such as the use of randomized algorithms and approximations of the objective function, can also be used to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithms.

In conclusion, the field of inverse problems is a rapidly evolving area, with new methods and techniques being developed to address the challenges of solving inverse problems in signal and image processing. The three routes mentioned above - Bayesian modeling, sparse regularization, and non-convex optimization - have been shown to be effective in solving a wide range of inverse problems, and new techniques are being developed to improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of the algorithms."," relations between these two approaches have lead to some widely spread misconceptions. In particular, while the so-called Maximum A Posterori (MAP) estimate with a Gaussian noise model does lead to an optimization problem with a quadratic data-fidelity term, we disprove through explicit examples the common belief that the converse would be true. It has already been shown [7, 9] that for denoising in the presence of additive Gaussian noise, for any prior probability on the unknowns, MMSE estimation can be expressed as a penalized least squares problem, with the apparent characteristics of a MAP estimation problem with Gaussian noise and a (generally) different prior on the unknowns. In other words, the variational approach is rich enough to build all possible MMSE estimators associated to additive Gaussian noise via a well chosen penalty. We generalize these results beyond Gaussian denoising and characterize noise models for which the same phenomenon occurs. In particular, we prove that with (a variant of) Poisson noise and any prior probability on the unknowns, MMSE estimation can again be expressed as the solution of a penalized least squares optimization problem. For additive scalar denois-ing the phenomenon holds if and only if the noise distribution is log-concave. In particular, Laplacian denoising can (perhaps surprisingly) be expressed as the solution of a penalized least squares problem. In the multivariate case, the same phenomenon occurs when the noise model belongs to a particular subset of the exponential family. For multivariate additive denoising, the phenomenon holds if and only if the noise is white and Gaussian."

The 1998 revival was notable for its innovative staging, which incorporated flying sequences and acrobatic feats to bring the magical world of Neverland to life. The show's choreographer, Wayne Cilento, worked closely with the cast to create a unique and captivating dance style that blended elements of ballet, modern, and tap.

The revival also featured a new song, ""I Won't Grow Up"", which was written by Carolyn Leigh and Mark Charlap. This song became a fan favorite and has since been included in many subsequent productions of Peter Pan.

Despite its initial success, the 1998 revival of Peter Pan was not without its challenges. The show's producers struggled to find the right balance between the fantastical elements of the story and the more serious themes of growing up and responsibility. The show's director, Nicholas Martin, worked closely with the cast and crew to refine the production and ensure that it stayed true to the spirit of Barrie's original play.

In the end, the 1998 revival of Peter Pan was a critical and commercial success, and it helped to cement the show's place as a beloved classic of American musical theater. The show's innovative staging, memorable performances, and timeless themes continue to captivate audiences to this day, and it remains one of the most popular and enduring adaptations of Barrie's beloved play.",", conductor Alexander Frey began research into whether there may have existed more material that Bernstein had composed for Peter Pan. Over the next seven years, as his schedule allowed, he discovered and restored almost an hour of previously unheard music, much of the material found (and not yet orchestrated) in the archives of the composer's manuscripts. The restored songs included ""Captain Hook Soliloquy"" and ""Dream With Me"", as well as other sung material, dance music and orchestral interludes. The world premiere recording of Bernstein's complete score was released on CD in 2005, conducted by Alexander Frey, and featuring Broadway star Linda Eder in the role of Wendy Darling, and acclaimed baritone Daniel Narducci as Captain Hook, on the Koch International Classics label.
In December 2006, it was produced for the stage by The King's Head Theatre in Islington, London, with Katherine Kastin as Peter Pan, Peter Land as Captain Hook, and Rafaella Hutchinson as Tinker Bell, directed by Stephanie Sinclaire and featuring new musical arrangements by Mike Dixon. This production used only parts of the Bernstein score and none of the original orchestrations. The music was performed by an instrumental trio.
In September 2008 the world premiere performance of the full Bernstein score was performed in concert with Alexander Frey conducting the Gulbenkian Orchestra, with dialogue adapted from the original J. M. Barrie play by Nina Bernstein Simmons. Three performances were given in Cascais, Portugal, for a combined audience of over 10,000 people, and featured Geraldine James (narrator), John Sackville-West (Peter Pan), Charlotte Ellett and Rachel Nicholls (Wendy) and Nicholas Lester (Captain Hook).
The first stage production of the full Bernstein score was given by Santa Barbara Theater (California) in December 2008, directed by Albert Ihde with a full orchestra again conducted by Alexander Frey.

Furthermore, we show that the geometric effects can be enhanced by the presence of magnetic field, leading to a significant modification of the orbital magnetic response. The finite-size corrections become more pronounced as the magnetic field increases, and can even change the sign of the magnetic susceptibility. This behavior is attributed to the interplay between the classical dynamics and the confinement geometry, which leads to a rich variety of phenomena. The theory is applicable to a wide range of systems, including quantum dots, graphene, and other two-dimensional electron systems.

In addition, we discuss the implications of our results for the experimental detection of the orbital magnetic response. We demonstrate that the finite-size corrections can be observed in high-quality samples, and that they can be used to probe the underlying classical dynamics. The theory also provides a new perspective on the role of geometry in the orbital magnetic response, and highlights the importance of considering the interplay between the classical dynamics and the confinement geometry. Overall, our results provide a new framework for understanding the orbital magnetic response of noninteracting electrons in two-dimensional potentials, and have important implications for the study of quantum systems in general."," than those which are chaotic. This difference arises from the large oscillations of the density of states in integrable systems due to the existence of families of periodic orbits. The connection between quantum and classical behavior naturally arises from the use of semiclassical expansions. This key tool becomes particularly simple and insightful at finite temperature, where only short classical trajectories need to be kept in the expansion. In addition to the general theory for integrable systems, we analyze in detail a few typical examples of experimental relevance: circles, rings and square billiards. In the latter, extensive numerical calculations are used as a check for the success of the semiclassical analysis. We study the weak-field regime where classical trajectories remain essentially unaffected, the intermediate field regime where we identify new oscillations characteristic for ballistic mesoscopic structures, and the high-field regime where the typical de Haas-van Alphen oscillations exhibit finite-size corrections. We address the comparison with experimental data obtained in high-mobility semiconductor microstructures discussing the differences between individual and ensemble measurements, and the applicability of the present model."
sad,id1459,human," can be unpredictable, we also consider the uncertainty in the target's position and the robot's motion. Our approach uses a finite-state machine to model the system and a model checker to verify the feasibility of each beam. By analyzing the model, we can determine the optimal order of beams that minimizes the treatment time while ensuring the robot and target are in a safe position. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce treatment times and improve the accuracy of robotic radiation therapy.

Our model considers the following components: the patient, the robot, the ultrasound transducer, the target, and the beams. The patient's breathing patterns and the target's motion are modeled using a probabilistic approach, allowing for uncertainty in the system. The robot's motion is modeled using a finite-state machine, which takes into account the robot's position and the beams' direction. The ultrasound transducer's position is also modeled, taking into account its movement and the beams' direction. The beams are modeled as a set of high-energy photon beams that are directed at the target. The model checker verifies the feasibility of each beam by checking if the robot and target are in a safe position, and if the beams are not passing through the ultrasound transducer or the robot. The optimal order of beams is determined by analyzing the model and selecting the beams that minimize the treatment time while ensuring the robot and target are in a safe position.

Our approach has several advantages over traditional methods. Firstly, it takes into account the uncertainty in the target's position and the robot's motion, which can be unpredictable. Secondly, it allows for the dynamic ordering of beams, which can reduce treatment times and improve the accuracy of the therapy. Thirdly, it provides a framework for verifying the feasibility of each beam, which can ensure the safety of the patient and the robot. Finally, it can be easily integrated with existing radiation therapy systems, making it a practical solution for clinical use."," are complex and change rapidly, any offline model would be too imprecise. Thus, model checking must be conducted online, predicting the patient's current breathing pattern for a short amount of time and checking which beams can be delivered safely. Monitoring the treatment delivery online provides the option to reschedule beams dynamically in order to avoid pausing and hence to reduce treatment time. While human breathing patterns are complex and may change rapidly, we need a model which can be verified quickly and use approximation by a superposition of sine curves. Further, we simplify the 3D breathing motion into separate 1D models. We compensate the simplification by adding noise inside the model itself. In turn, we synchronize between the multiple models representing the different spatial directions, the treatment simulation, and corresponding verification queries. Our preliminary results show a 16.02 % to 37.21 % mean improvement on the idle time compared to a static beam schedule, depending on an additional safety margin. Note that an additional safety margin around the ultrasound robot can decrease idle times but also compromises plan quality by limiting the range of available beam directions. In contrast, the approach using online model checking maintains the plan quality. Further, we compare to a naive machine learning approach that does not achieve its goals while being harder to reason about."

&gt;The effort is expected to produce 10 million face masks per week, which will be distributed to healthcare workers across the country. This will help to alleviate the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) that has been plaguing hospitals and healthcare facilities.

&gt;Parkdale Mills Inc. has a long history of producing yarn and fabric for the textile industry, but this new effort marks a significant departure from their usual operations. The company has had to quickly adapt to the changing circumstances and has been working around the clock to set up the new production line.

&gt;The companies involved in the effort are using their collective resources and expertise to overcome the challenges of producing a large quantity of face masks in a short amount of time. They are working together to share knowledge, resources, and equipment to ensure that the masks meet the highest standards of quality and safety.

&gt;The face masks will be made from a variety of materials, including cotton, polyester, and blends of the two. They will be designed to be comfortable, breathable, and easy to clean, making them ideal for healthcare workers who need to wear them for extended periods of time.

&gt;The production of the face masks will be a complex process, involving multiple steps and stages. The companies involved will need to work together to ensure that each step is completed efficiently and effectively, in order to meet the high demand for the masks.

&gt;As the production of the face masks gets underway, the companies involved are already seeing the impact that their efforts are having. Healthcare workers are receiving the masks and are reporting that they are comfortable and effective in protecting them from the spread of the virus.

&gt;The effort by Parkdale Mills Inc. and the other companies involved is a testament to the power of collaboration and the importance of working together to overcome challenges. In these uncertain times, it is heartening to see companies put aside their differences and come together to make a difference.

&gt;As the country continues to grapple with the pandemic, the production of face masks will play a critical role in helping to slow the spread of the virus. The efforts of Parkdale Mills Inc. and the other companies involved will help to ensure that healthcare workers have the PPE they need to stay safe and healthy, and that the country can continue to move forward in the face of this crisis.

&gt;The production of face masks is just one part of the larger effort to combat the pandemic. Other companies and organizations are also working together to develop vaccines, treatments, and other solutions to help mitigate the spread of the virus.

&gt;As the situation continues to evolve, it is clear that the response to the pandemic will require a coordinated effort from government, industry, and individuals. The efforts of Parkdale Mills Inc. and the other companies involved are a shining example of the kind of collaboration and innovation that will be needed to overcome this crisis."," most monumental challenges,” the statement said.

&gt;Across the country, medical workers face a shortage of personal protective equipment on the front lines of the response to COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. Health officials have said that panic-buying of the masks by people who do not need them can exacerbate the shortage, forcing health care workers to reuse or improvise protective equipment, often with greater risk.

&gt;Anderson Warlick, the president and CEO of Parkdale, worked closely with White House officials to expedite the process through “bureaucratic red tape,” the NCTO said, allowing production to begin soon after the masks were approved and certified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

&gt;Production is expected to begin on Monday, the NCTO said, with deliveries starting in the middle of the week. Once at full capacity (in about four to five weeks) the coalition expects to produce up to 10 million face masks per week.

I start to wonder why my life isn't as perfect as everyone else's, why I'm not as successful, or why I don't have as many followers. The constant bombardment of curated content makes me feel like I'm not good enough, like I'm missing out on something essential to being happy. And yet, when I take a step back and look at my own life, I realize that I do have so much to be grateful for. I have a loving family, supportive friends, and a roof over my head. I have the opportunity to learn and grow every day, to pursue my passions and interests. But somehow, in the midst of all this abundance, I still feel like I'm missing something.

As I continue to navigate this complex and often overwhelming world, I've come to realize that happiness is not something that can be found in a post or a selfie. It's not something that can be bought or sold. It's not something that can be achieved through external validation or material possessions. Happiness is something that comes from within, something that is cultivated through self-reflection, self-care, and self-love.

It's a journey, not a destination. It's a process of growth and learning, of embracing our imperfections and our vulnerabilities. It's a choice to focus on the present moment, to let go of the past and the future, and to find joy in the simple things. It's a choice to prioritize our well-being, to take care of our physical, emotional, and mental health. It's a choice to surround ourselves with people who uplift and support us, who encourage us to be our authentic selves.

And so, as I continue on this journey of self-discovery and growth, I'm learning to let go of the need for external validation. I'm learning to focus on my own strengths and accomplishments, to celebrate my wins and to learn from my failures. I'm learning to be kind to myself, to practice self-compassion, and to prioritize my own well-being. I'm learning to find happiness in the everyday moments, to appreciate the little things, and to find joy in the simple pleasures.

cchap22: My wife and I have been discussing this since seeing your beautifully worded question. 

I have 2 answers. The first one stems from a discussion from a dying mother on her death bed. She explained that looking back in your life you aren't going to care about how you looked on your date in junior year of high school, how good your hair looked in 10th grade  or the days binging your favorite shows. You remember the loved ones around you, the life that created you, and the life you create. Family and people will bring you moments of true and utter bliss... happiness

Answer #2 Only with true sorrow can you achieve true happiness. You have to live the dark to feel the light. You are going, 14 years old, my guess is you have never hit rock bottom, you have never wanted to die more than live, and as such you have never been lifted out of this. Right now most everything in your life is plastic, fake and skin deep. I know this sounds kind of brutal but it's true. You haven't had to slave your fingers to the bone to ensure you're child has food on there plate,  so you haven't experienced the warm feeling of watching them eat knowing you provided that life. 

A good example of this was when I was about 22 years old. My gf and me at the time were being evicted, she just lost her job and her car was totalled. We were facing the prospect of living homeless and had not eaten in almost 2 whole days. It was pure misery. My parents ended up letting us move in until we saved enough to be back on our feet. Waking up that next morning in a clean bed, central heating, breakfast on the skillet, and Sunday morning cartoons... that is true happiness. It washes over you like a warmth and you never forget

As I continued to read through the conversation, I realized that it's not just about the arrow, but also about the nuances of language and communication. It's amazing how something as simple as a question mark can have such a significant impact on the meaning of a sentence. I started to think about how often we use language in a way that's not entirely accurate, and how important it is to be mindful of these subtleties.

I began to wonder if there were other areas of life where we might be misunderstanding or miscommunicating due to small errors in language. For instance, what if we were misinterpreting a tone or a gesture because we didn't fully understand the cultural context? Or what if we were misreading someone's intentions because we didn't take the time to ask clarifying questions?

As I pondered these questions, I started to think about the importance of active listening and clear communication. It's not just about getting our point across, but also about truly understanding the other person's perspective. By doing so, we can build stronger relationships, resolve conflicts more effectively, and avoid misunderstandings altogether.

I realized that this conversation about the arrow on the hose was just a small part of a much larger conversation about language, communication, and human connection. It was a reminder that even the smallest details can have a significant impact, and that by paying attention to these details, we can create a more harmonious and effective way of communicating with one another."," of the question because it's the internet and not a English literature paper.

MoreIsLessIsMore: The “Are you sure?” Would be the question, the “Because...” would be the clarification, not the question.

The difference is that you didn’t ask a question. If you had said “Are you sure, because every Toyota I’ve ever owned had it?” it still would have had been improper use of the question mark. Proper usage would have been  “Are you sure? Every Toyota I’ve ever owned had it.” Do you see the difference between the two? 

Regardless of whether or not it is an English literature paper, clearly the proper usage of certain syntax is important in day-to-day situations, as multiple users here have pointed out their confusion as to why you used a question mark either by asking you why, or by upvoting that question. In the context that you used the question mark, it suggests confusion on your part as opposed to asking a question (eg - “Every one I’ve owned has had it?” - confusion as to whether or not every one you have owned did have it). 

Hopefully that clears it up a bit for you. 
Ukmkiv: I understood your point from the first time you made it... my counter argument was that of using colloquial language on internet forums as to be honest there's no reason for use of propper sentence structure... there is also the chance that people who have upvoted agree with the point being made that all Toyotas have either the arrow or the pipe is there not?

And let's not forget that the Biden administration's American Rescue Plan, which was passed in March 2021, provided a significant amount of relief to individuals and businesses affected by the pandemic. While it's true that the administration did not provide as much relief as some had hoped, it's unfair to say that they did ""massively less"" than the Trump administration.

In fact, the Trump administration's CARES Act, which was passed in March 2020, provided a one-time payment of $1,200 to individuals and $2,400 to married couples, as well as expanded unemployment benefits and other forms of relief. While the CARES Act was a significant response to the pandemic, it was not a sustainable solution and did not address the underlying structural issues that contributed to the deficit.

The Biden administration's approach has been more focused on addressing the root causes of the deficit, such as the rising cost of healthcare and the need for infrastructure investment. While these efforts may not have resulted in a significant decrease in the deficit in the short term, they are designed to promote long-term economic growth and stability.

So, let's not try to spin this narrative to fit our own agenda. Let's focus on the facts and have a honest discussion about the federal deficit and how we can work together to address it."," lowering something. That is bullshit. And if CNN agrees you have to be utterly dishonest to push that crap.
RnDanger: Those are the numbers. He didn't lie. He's just taking credit for something you wish he couldn't but if I'm honest, Trump would have kept fucking up the response so we actually do have to give some credit to leadership.
libertyordeaaathh: No, he is taking credit for something he literally didn’t do. Nor is that counted as deficits spending. You don’t understand, he is changing the definitions of terms to lie to you. And because of your hatred of someone else you are buying into it hook line and sinker. He as raised government spending massively and saying he lowered it. It’s part of a string of lies he is feeding you. Are you buying his gas was $5 a gallon when he came in too? It wasn’t. 

You are the exact person he is telling this shit too because you refuse to think for yourself. If he told you night was day you would buy it because you do no thinking of your own. 

But enjoy your Tuesday 🤣🙄
RnDanger: Do you believe that every person who tells you your facts are wrong does it out of hatred? Do you understand that spending does not equal deficit?
libertyordeaaathh: Lol. Well let’s see, I teach business at a university. But you are probably right, you know more than me an CNN. 

You are a sycophant which makes you boring. Goodby
RnDanger: Good interaction. Thank you.
libertyordeaaathh: https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/05/politics/fact-check-biden-midterms-2022/index.html
RnDanger: Thank you. There are some good points here. I do think they are sticklers, which is fine for a fact check.
libertyordeaaathh: Come on, you have to consider the source. There is a reason I and others are bringing up CNN. It is a liberal of source as you can find. So you have to assume that they are putting it in as good of possible light for Biden as they can. It means even a liberal has to admit this is dishonest. And if you are going to be a logical thinking you have to assume it is actually worse than CNN said.
RnDanger: These are bad assumptions but thank you for sharing the link.
libertyordeaaathh: They are not bad assumptions. They are absolute logic based assumptions. Wow you have gone down the liberal whole deep. If you don’t acknowledge the bias of your own side then you are very apt to follow any direction they send you. It is t even arguable that CNN is liberal or that they put things in a good light for democrats. It is widely acknowledged and the new leader of CNN has even said he is trying to push them back more toward the center has they had gone way way too far left. It says more about you that you can’t see it.

I am a conservative no doubt about it. But I do not buy anything Fox, or Breitbart, or Red Sate says at face value. I always read the opposing views and all source material when possible. This times it’s isnt even a close call. He is lying.

sad,id1761,human,": Yeah, Texas is a good climate for an outdoor oven, but you still need to keep an eye on it. I'd recommend applying a waterproof coating or sealant to the bricks to prevent any moisture from seeping in. And don't forget to clean it regularly to prevent any debris from building up and causing damage.

Additionally, you might want to consider using refractory mortar to hold the bricks together. It's specifically designed to withstand high temperatures and can help prevent the bricks from shifting or cracking over time. And if you do notice any cracks or damage, it's better to address them early on to prevent further deterioration.

kevin530: That's a great idea! I didn't think of that. I'll make sure to do that. Do you have any recommendations for the type of mortar to use? And what kind of maintenance routine should I follow?

eldorel: Ah, great question! For refractory mortar, I'd recommend using a high-temperature rated mortar specifically designed for outdoor pizza ovens. You can find it at most home improvement stores or online. Just make sure to follow the instructions and mix it according to the manufacturer's guidelines.

As for maintenance, I'd suggest cleaning the oven after each use, and doing a deeper clean every 6-12 months. You can use a wire brush to scrub away any food residue and debris, and then wipe it down with a damp cloth. If you notice any stubborn stains or buildup, you can use a mixture of baking soda and water to scrub it away.

It's also a good idea to inspect the oven regularly for any signs of damage or wear and tear. Check for any cracks or gaps in the bricks, and make sure the chimney is clear and free of debris. And don't forget to check the temperature gauge regularly to ensure it's accurate and functioning properly.

kevin530: That sounds like a solid plan. I'll make sure to follow that routine. Thanks for the advice, I feel a lot more confident now that I'll be able to keep my oven running smoothly.",": Having built a couple of brick ovens for my brother the baker, one tip I can give you is to bring the oven up to temp VERY slowly. 

Instead of using a large fire to get the oven hot (which is the normal technique), build a smaller fire and let the brick warm slowly over the course of an hour or so.

Then clear the small fire and built your actual fire to get the oven up to the ~350+ that you need for whatever you are planning to cook. 

That gives the heat plenty of time to penetrate the brick and the moisture can steam out safely.

Otherwise the inner face of the brick gets too hot compared to the middle of the brick and there is a chance of flash heating as the high heat reaches the moisture inside. 

kevin530: Thanks for the tip! Sounds pretty reasonable. We ""seasoned"" the bricks by doing this - everyday for 5 days we made a bigger and hotter fire. Starting out with a very small 200 degree fire and ending with the 800 degree fire.
eldorel: If you're planning on consistently going into the 800 degree range then you are going to start having problems pretty quickly.  

Are you planning on cooking 20+ inch pizzas, are you working on loaves of bread, or are you planning to cook multiple items with only one firing? 

The oven my brother used for demonstrations was about the size of your oven, and and hour fired to 650 was usually enough to do an entire flat ( 9 loaves ) and a large pizza after the demo.

Even if you gently condition the oven every time the humidity gets above 60%, at 800 degrees that mortar will probably start breaking down just from the heat after a few months.  

After looking at the photos again, do you have a door for that oven, or are you leaving it open?
kevin530: Leaving it open
eldorel: You should make a door for it.
It helps the oven to heat up faster, and lets you use a smaller fire to get the oven to temp. It also helps keep the oven at the right temperature for much longer. 

You can see an example of one we made on top of the oven in [this](http://i.imgur.com/FMg3t41.jpg) photo.

That one is a handle attached to two layers of wood with a layer of leather cover in a canvas pad. 
The entire door gets dipped in water every time before being wedged into the opening, and it has a 1/2 inch opening for draft above the door.  

We have a hinged metal and wood door on his normal oven. (hinges on the right side attached to a 2 inch thick wooden door with a 1/2inch steel plate on the fire-side face.)

This lack of foresight has led to a perfect storm of shortages and delays, with companies scrambling to find alternative suppliers and sources. It's not just textiles, either - we're seeing shortages of everything from semiconductors to medical equipment to even simple household items.

And it's not just the companies that are affected - consumers are feeling the pinch as well. Delays in shipping and production mean that products are taking longer to arrive, and when they do, they're often in short supply. It's a frustrating and frustrating experience, especially for those who need these products for important events or milestones.

But what's even more concerning is the long-term impact this could have on the global supply chain. With companies relying so heavily on just-in-time production, they're leaving themselves vulnerable to disruptions and shortages. It's a recipe for disaster, and one that could have far-reaching consequences for the economy and society as a whole.

In the meantime, it's up to consumers to be prepared and flexible. Whether it's finding alternative sources for the products they need or being willing to wait for delivery, it's crucial that we're proactive and adaptable in the face of these shortages. And for companies, it's time to take a step back and re-evaluate their supply chain strategies. It's time to remember that sometimes, having a little extra inventory on hand can be a lifesaver.

As we move forward, it's clear that the global shortage of textiles is just the tip of the iceberg. We're facing a complex and interconnected web of supply chain issues, and it's going to take a concerted effort from all parties involved to get things back on track. But with a little bit of creativity, flexibility, and foresight, I'm confident that we can overcome these challenges and emerge stronger and more resilient on the other side."," that can not be quickly sourced from alternate suppliers.

The idea of just in time production is to **limit** the need for storage. Most of the people implementing just in time production instead try to **eliminate** storage.
materialdesigner: So you’re gonna keep enough supply to operate for 2-7 years on the risk of an unexpected pandemic creating ongoing global supply chain issues? 

You’ll get murdered on cash flow with that much wasted inventory rotting away.
Wisecouncil: No, but a 6-12 month supply allows them to operate while looking for alternative suppliers, or find solutions for the missing critical components (new designs, alternate process/materials ECT.)

At the vet least it lets them operate 6+ months longer than their competition, and any deliveries they receive during that time extends failure deadline.
materialdesigner: You’re an olive oil manufacturer based in the UK who operates an oil mill on Crete in Greece and then imports the oil into the UK. Your product is heavy and highly susceptible to heat and light degradation. It’s has no seasonal demand fluctuation but is highly seasonal in production. The quality of your product is associated with its freshness. 

What do you do when shipping collapses?


You are an electronic Oven manufacturer in France. You source your printed circuit board manufacturing from a semiconductor company in Germany. You just finished your production run of the 2023 model of your oven. You’ve been working on the 2024 chip and board design and are ready to send it off to production.

What do you do when circuit board manufacturers collapse due to the precipitous drop in demand from vehicle manufacturers? 

It is literally *not that simple* and the idea of keeping a 6-12 month supply of “key components” is a non-starter in lots of markets.
betsapp91: yea but this doesn’t apply to textiles at all
materialdesigner: That’s just not true. The entire demand for clothes plummeted in an instant. What used to be predictable production runs suddenly became completely unknown. Factories were closed because they were not essential business, layoffs shrunk the workforce. As demand picked back up the factories were not prepared to absorb it and grow back to original sizes.
betsapp91: a sharp drop in demand can kill any business, but your comment focused on how many businesses can’t store perishables and that part doesn’t translate to cloth
materialdesigner: Semiconductors and printed circuit boards are perishables now?
betsapp91: ???

i didn’t call it perishable lol cloth isn’t seasonal and doesn’t get obsoleted every year, these are not the same

In reality, allowing a pet to become pregnant and have a litter can lead to a multitude of health issues, not to mention the potential for behavioral problems. For example, a female dog that has been bred can experience a range of health complications, including uterine infections, breast tumors, and even life-threatening conditions such as pyometra. Additionally, breeding can also lead to behavioral issues, such as anxiety, aggression, and even separation anxiety.

Moreover, spaying or neutering a pet can actually improve their behavior and reduce the risk of certain health issues. Studies have shown that spayed or neutered pets are less likely to engage in undesirable behaviors, such as roaming, marking territory, or engaging in fights with other animals. They are also less likely to develop certain health issues, such as uterine infections or testicular cancer.

It's also important to note that spaying or neutering a pet does not mean that they will lose their natural instincts or behaviors. For example, a spayed or neutered dog may still exhibit playful and affectionate behaviors, such as licking and cuddling. They may also still have a strong prey drive or a desire to chase small animals, but these behaviors will not be driven by the need to mate or reproduce.

In conclusion, while allowing a pet to become pregnant and have a litter may seem like a harmless or even desirable option, it can actually lead to a range of health and behavioral issues. Spaying or neutering a pet, on the other hand, can improve their overall health and well-being, and reduce the risk of certain health issues. It's important for pet owners to consider these factors and make informed decisions about their pets' reproductive health."," needs to do it and there is no ""magic"" that turns them into better pets because ""they had their own babies to love"". 

Spaying early on while pets are still young can not only prevent a lot of problems including uterine cancer but neutering males young can prevent any prostate problems or even testicular cancer. And in lots of areas there is low cost help, including fixing cats as low as $20 each. 

OP, I hope your dog recovers and has a long cancer free life.
K_J_W: You are so right. Our male dog was aggressive and would run. We were told if you neuter him.. he will stop. It did not. As he ages, he is getting better with being aggressive/reactive and running. He still does stuff that is frustrating out of a game for him. But the neutering wasn't the solve all. 
Our female has sensory issues. If she would have puppies it would have killed her. Mentally and physically.
WowSeriously666: I feel for you OP and have had similar struggles. I had an adopted beagle as a child that was neutered after he was fully grown and it did nothing to stop him from jumping the fence and running the neighborhood trying to fight every dog in it. I remember I was always on my bike trying to hunt him down. At least we knew he couldn't make any little baby beagles. 

My vet now has always advocated spaying and neutering pets. I ended up adopting my brothers large yellow Lab when he moved to Florida. He was never one to neuter his dogs because apparently neutering a male dog is just too personal for some guys. At least that's what he always said. When the dog was about seven years old he started having health issues. Turned out he was having prostate problems. I was told the first step would be to neuter him which would take care of the testosterone which would hopefully solve the prostate problems, if not more surgery would be needed. Thankfully neutering him solved his prostate issues. 

Once a male dog has gone through puberty and had testosterone surging through his system neutering them really does very little to nothing to change their personality. The same for male cats, once they have the testosterone in their system you can't magically change their personality back to cute kitten-hood by neutering them. that's why they always tell you if you want to prevent spraying you must neuter them early.
samking86: I had my dog neutered at around 6 months hoping it would keep him from running off and looking for females. 

It didn't work.
Aromatic-Box-592: Neutering isn’t a magical fix all, neutered male dogs still think intact females smell *really* good (lol) but with training you should be able to stop him!
samking86: He has proven me wrong time and time again so now he gets put on his chain unless we are out there with him. We live in the country so a fence isn't an option and it's chickens he's after not females.

I'm not sure how much more efficient lab grown meat is, but I've seen some videos that show the carbon footprint of these facilities is just as bad as traditional farming. And what about the resources needed to build and maintain these facilities? It's not a sustainable solution.

4. Food safety
I'm also worried about the food safety of lab grown meat. We've seen recalls and contamination issues with traditional meat, and I'm not sure how well lab grown meat is regulated. What if there's a contamination issue with lab grown meat? How do we ensure the public's safety?

5. Taste and texture
I've tried lab grown meat before, and to be honest, it doesn't taste like the real thing. It's like eating a processed meat product. And the texture is all wrong. I know some people might not care about the taste and texture, but for me, it's a big deal.

In conclusion, I'm not convinced that lab grown meat is a better alternative. I think we need to consider the potential consequences of adopting this technology, and make sure that it's a sustainable and safe solution for the environment, farmers, and consumers."," quality
While I understand the meat industry has some criticisms over quality. Im more concerned about lab grown meat. What if the meat that is constructed contains  chemicals worse than the ones we already eat? Every food item wether new or old tends to have this problem found out later on. But since this is lab grown its more of a concern as to what they put in it.

Note: Im heavily optimistic about new alternatives. The idea of lab grown meat isn't whats making me skeptical. Im just concerned it will make new problems along with it
PeteWenzel: I don’t think there is an ethical argument against abandoning the keeping of farm animals. Most of these animals’ life is pure torture. The conditions are much worse than any being capable of feeling physical and mental pain/distress should ever have to endure.

Furthermore they are not wild animals. We have bred them according to our own interest in such a way that they are grotesquely deformed and not part of the natural biosphere or food chain, anymore.

But I’m sure we will keep some in zoos or even in farms for those who want to continue eating “natural” meat.


Farmers would have to grow fruits, vegetables, bio fuel, etc.


I don’t think the government would allow contaminated meat to be sold. Furthermore the media and consumers will be very cautious about this new meat and companies couldn’t risk any scandals because the public relations damage would mean that consumers lost trust and stuck with the traditional alternative for a while longer.



GordonMongolian: What confuses me about the first statement is that we have been owning animals as either pets or for slaughter for a really long time. Im not arguing about the big time companies as I am with many people on that subject that its wrong. But raising them fully and killing them letting experience life is fine to me.
PeteWenzel: Animal abuse has always been part of the keeping of farm animals: Separation of mother and child, mutilation, premature slaughter, etc.

Even if all farm animals had wonderful lifestyles today, not having them around wouldn’t make a moral difference. No one is suffering because he/she was never born.

Also, you forgot impact on the planet. The carbon footprint of traditional meat production is huge.
GordonMongolian: The problem has always been there which is true. But farmers tend to keep the younglings to grow their cattle hoard. As for the bigger industries they tend to do this tactic a lot more considering the huge population of cows already present.

I couldn't agree more with [deleted]. While it's admirable to take a stand for one's principles, it's equally important to acknowledge the privilege and circumstances that allow some individuals to do so. Mr. Dinklage's decision to speak out against the lack of diversity in the entertainment industry is commendable, but it's also important to recognize that he has a platform and resources that many others do not.

The people who truly take a stand at personal cost are often those who are marginalized, oppressed, or silenced. They are the ones who face real consequences, such as loss of livelihood, social ostracism, or even physical harm, for speaking out against injustice. They are the ones who have to navigate complex systems of oppression and exploitation, and who have to find ways to survive and thrive in the face of adversity.

We often hear about the brave individuals who risk everything to fight for a cause, but we rarely hear about the countless others who do the same, often without recognition or reward. We rarely hear about the activists, organizers, and advocates who work tirelessly behind the scenes, often without compensation or recognition, to bring about change.

These individuals are the true heroes, the ones who are willing to take a stand even when it's hard, even when it's unpopular, and even when it's dangerous. They are the ones who are willing to put their lives on the line, to risk everything, to fight for a better world.

And yet, we often overlook them, we often ignore them, and we often silence them. We prioritize the voices of the privileged, the powerful, and the famous, and we forget about the voices of the marginalized, the oppressed, and the silenced.

But it's time for us to change that. It's time for us to recognize the true heroes, the ones who are willing to take a stand at personal cost. It's time for us to amplify their voices, to support their work, and to create a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.",", most of them stuck in wage slavery, continually trying to fight against a system designed to make them fail. How about the people who are whistleblowers? They stood up for their principles at the cost of their entire lives and livelihoods, what about them?

noth1ngspecific: I'm not attacking you personally, Aksurah. I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy in your argument. You're saying that my wife wouldn't speak to me for a week if I used the couch as a plate, but you're not willing to acknowledge the absurdity of your own statement.

Aksurah: I think we're getting bogged down in semantics here. The point is, using the couch as a plate is not acceptable behavior, regardless of who does it. It's not about being pretentious, it's about being considerate of others and taking care of our belongings.

jalletoi: [Small improvements here and there.](http://youtu.be/1OZco971baA) Mildly excited about early summer and the training places of my new neighborhood.
legatostaccato: sweet apartment, big open space and all. where'd you find that park? i've never seen one THAT well equipped so far.
jalletoi: Yes quite plenty of room but only with minimalistic furniture :D 

I'm surprised how good parks there are nowadays. Guess some of it is thanks to the active street workout members of Finland. I recently discovered one park that might be even better with hanging rings&amp;ropes. Might shoot some short video of it at some point.
legatostaccato: hah, i'm moving to a new apartment within 3 weeks now-- with slightly less minimalistic furniture, will be fun trying to fit all the exercise stuff in.

in parks, the ""rings"" i see are always just those blue rubbery chain things. but pull-up bars and monkey bars are fairly common at least. maybe i should look around more.
jalletoi: Yes I'm also waiting for the arrival of a sofa bed and kitchen table. But with good imagination I guess they can just be viewed as new training equipment :D

Those blue rubber rings are really not good for anything. Maybe hanging or OACs but nothing else. Very rare to see proper rings outside. I wish they made similar as those high hanging metal ones at muscle beach CA to elsewhere.

sad,id1358,human," informatics has revolutionized the healthcare industry by enabling healthcare providers to make data-driven decisions, improve patient outcomes, and reduce costs.

In addition to these advancements, health informatics has also enabled the development of telemedicine platforms, allowing patients to consult with healthcare providers remotely. This has improved access to healthcare services, particularly in rural and underserved areas. Furthermore, health informatics has facilitated the development of personalized medicine, enabling healthcare providers to tailor treatment plans to individual patients based on their unique genetic profiles and medical histories.

Another significant application of health informatics is in the area of medical imaging analysis. With the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, healthcare providers can now analyze medical images such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans more accurately and efficiently. This has enabled earlier detection and diagnosis of diseases, leading to better patient outcomes.

Health informatics has also enabled the development of electronic health records (EHRs), which are digital versions of patients' medical records. EHRs have improved the quality and safety of patient care by providing healthcare providers with access to accurate and up-to-date patient information. Additionally, EHRs have enabled healthcare providers to track patient outcomes and identify areas for improvement.

In conclusion, health informatics has transformed the healthcare industry by enabling the efficient and effective use of information technology to improve patient care. With its applications in telemedicine, personalized medicine, medical imaging analysis, and electronic health records, health informatics has the potential to revolutionize the way healthcare services are delivered. As the field continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative applications of health informatics in the future."," informatics makes medical care intelligent, interactive, cost-effective, and accessible; especially with DL application tools for detecting the actual cause of diseases. The extensive use of neural network tools leads to the expansion of different medical disciplines which mitigates data complexity and enhances 3-4D overlap images using target point label data detectors that support data augmentation, un-semi-supervised learning, multi-modality and transfer learning architecture. Health science over the years focused on artificial intelligence tools for care delivery, chronic care management, prevention/wellness, clinical supports, and diagnosis. The outcome of their research leads to cardiac arrest diagnosis through Heart Signal Computer-Aided Diagnostic tool (CADX) and other multifunctional deep learning techniques that offer care, diagnosis \& treatment. Health informatics provides monitored outcomes of human body organs through medical images that classify interstitial lung disease, detects image nodules for reconstruction \& tumor segmentation. The emergent medical research applications gave rise to clinical-pathological human-level performing tools for handling Radiological, Ophthalmological, and Dental diagnosis. This research will evaluate methodologies, Deep learning architectures, approaches, bio-informatics, specified function requirements, monitoring tools, ANN (artificial neural network), data labeling \& annotation algorithms that control data validation, modeling, and diagnosis of different diseases using smart monitoring health informatics applications."
sad,id499,human," a course on natural disaster management), I think it's crucial that we invest in our own infrastructure to prevent or at least mitigate the effects of such disasters.

In fact, I've seen some studies that suggest that a tsunami warning system could be implemented along the East Coast, which is more prone to tsunamis due to its proximity to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It would require a significant investment, but it could potentially save thousands of lives.

It's also important to note that tsunamis are not just a coastal issue. The effects of a tsunami can be felt inland, and it's not uncommon for the water to rise by several feet in areas that are far from the coast. This is why it's crucial to have evacuation plans in place for inland areas as well.

PThompson509: That's a great point. I've heard that some cities in the US are already working on implementing tsunami evacuation plans.
LocalGae: Exactly! And it's not just about the planning, it's also about education and awareness. People need to know what to do in case of a tsunami, and they need to know how to respond quickly and safely.

It's also important to note that tsunamis are not just a natural disaster, they're also a human-made disaster. Climate change is causing sea levels to rise, which increases the risk of tsunamis. And let's not forget about the impact of human activities such as coastal development and deforestation, which can increase the risk of landslides and other natural disasters.

PThompson509: That's a great point. I never thought about the connection between climate change and tsunamis.
LocalGae: Yeah, it's a complex issue, but it's one that we need to address. And it's not just about the science, it's also about the politics. We need to have policies in place that prioritize disaster risk reduction and management.

In conclusion, tsunamis are a serious threat, but with proper planning, education, and awareness, we can reduce the risk of loss of life and property. It's a complex issue, but it's one that we can't ignore."," a college course on the subject) you guys also don’t have great buildings in terms on tsunamis or earthquakes. Bright side, most of the area seems to be on a huge slope so the tsunamis don’t reach as high and far.
PolyklietosOfAthens: I'm am architecture student in California. I can't speak for tsunamis, but I know California is the hardest state to be licensed in because the structural standards for earthquakes are so high. Most NEW buildings are very well protected from earthquakes, at least compared to the rest of the United States. Old buildings, yeah they might have some problems.
LocalGae: That is great to hear! Do you happen to know how they deal with liquefaction? Do you also learn about tsunami proofing? And if so, can you tell me some of the measures taken?
PolyklietosOfAthens: I'll preface this by saying my program is much more theoretical/conceptual than most. It's all about pretty artistic designs with lots of studio classes and not a whole lot of hard skills in engineering. The thought there is that every project will have loads of consultants and engineers working in it so the architect doesn't have to deal with. If there are technical issues that come up, the architect can refer to them. Common misconception, but in reality the architect is much more of a conductor than a musician, if you'll pardon the metaphor. Their main goal is to understand the legal process and ensure the building is designed to the clients agreement and to code (not built to code, that's the contractors job). 

Liquefaction sounds like something a surveyor would take care of. Combating that comes down a lot to the way the structural foundations are designed and built. If it's projected that in the future, say 10 years from now, the ground won't be stable enough to hold the building due to its location or soil conditions, they would likely tell the architect the site is bad and the architect would then tell the client this before an agreement is signed. It's the architects job to know a little about everything but not neccesarily deep knowledge about certain topics, that's what he/she has their team for. 

I have not done much research into tsunami proofing and it hasn't come up in class yet. The emphasis right now is on mitigating damage due to tectonic movement (earthquakes) and wind forces. If a building is bound to fall down anyway, we need to make sure it falls down in a way that hurts as few people as possible. California building code has no provisions that give any requirements for a building to be resistant to tsunamis. However, if a building were to be designed to resistant to tsunamis it would want to be oriented and formed in such a way that they water could flow past it easily and exert as little force as possible on it. It's like trying to push a cruise ship sideways through water, it's not going to work. That's why the ships are built narrow so the water can go around them.  

Hope I answered your question!
LocalGae: Yes! Thank you so much for your time!

Despite the intense rivalry, both Cope and Marsh made significant contributions to the field of paleontology, discovering many new species of dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. Cope's discoveries included the hadrosaurid dinosaur Anatosaurus and the ceratopsian dinosaur Pentaceratops, while Marsh's discoveries included the triceratops Triceratops and the allosaur Allosaurus. The rivalry between the two scientists also led to a greater understanding of the prehistoric world, as they pushed each other to new heights of discovery and innovation.

The Bone Wars came to an end in the early 1890s, when Cope's health began to decline and Marsh's reputation began to suffer from the intense scrutiny of the scientific community. Marsh's methods had become increasingly questionable, and his attacks on Cope had begun to damage his own reputation. In the end, it was Marsh who emerged as the more successful of the two scientists, with a greater number of discoveries and a more lasting impact on the field of paleontology. Despite this, the rivalry between Cope and Marsh remains one of the most fascinating and enduring stories in the history of science."," to finance their own expeditions and to procure services and dinosaur bones from fossil hunters. By the end of the Bone Wars, both men had exhausted their funds in the pursuit of paleontological supremacy.
Cope and Marsh were financially and socially ruined by their attempts to outcompete and disgrace each other, but they made important contributions to science and the field of paleontology and provided substantial material for further work—both scientists left behind many unopened boxes of fossils after their deaths. The efforts of the two men led to more than 136 new species of dinosaurs being discovered and described. The products of the Bone Wars resulted in an increase in knowledge of prehistoric life, and sparked the public's interest in dinosaurs, leading to continued fossil excavation in North America in the decades to follow. Many historical books and fictional adaptations have been published about this period of intense fossil-hunting activity."

One possible approach to solving the dependent doors problem is to use a randomized algorithm. The idea is to assign a random probability to each door, and then knock on the door with the highest probability. If the door opens, the algorithm repeats the process with the remaining doors. If the door does not open, the algorithm moves on to the next door with the highest probability. This approach has been shown to be effective in certain cases, but it can be slow in practice and may not always find the optimal solution.

Another approach is to use a deterministic algorithm, which makes decisions based on the current state of the doors. For example, the algorithm might always knock on the door that has the highest probability of opening, given the current state of the other doors. This approach can be more efficient than the randomized approach, but it may not always find the optimal solution.

In addition to these two approaches, there are many other possible ways to solve the dependent doors problem. For example, one could use a combination of randomized and deterministic algorithms, or use a different probability distribution for each door. The choice of algorithm will depend on the specific characteristics of the problem and the desired trade-off between efficiency and optimality.

Despite the challenges of the dependent doors problem, it has been shown to have many real-world applications. For example, it can be used to model the problem of opening a set of files on a computer, where each file may depend on other files being open in order to be accessible. It can also be used to model the problem of scheduling a set of tasks, where each task may depend on other tasks being completed in order to be started. The dependent doors problem is a fundamental problem in computer science and operations research, and it continues to be an active area of research and development."," opened. In this work, we focus on scenarios where dependencies between doors are both positively correlated and acyclic.The fundamental distribution of a door describes the probability it opens in the best of conditions (with respect to other doors being open or closed). We show that if in two configurations of $d$ doors corresponding doors share the same fundamental distribution, then these configurations have the same optimal running time up to a universal constant, no matter what are the dependencies between doors and what are the distributions. We also identify algorithms that are optimal up to a universal constant factor. For the case in which all doors share the same fundamental distribution we additionally provide a simpler algorithm, and a formula to calculate its running time. We furthermore analyse the price of lacking feedback for several configurations governed by standard fundamental distributions. In particular, we show that the price is logarithmic in $d$ for memoryless doors, but can potentially grow to be linear in $d$ for other distributions.We then turn our attention to investigate precise bounds. Even for the case of two doors, identifying the optimal sequence is an intriguing combinatorial question. Here, we study the case of two cascading memoryless doors. That is, the first door opens on each knock independently with probability $p\_1$. The second door can only open if the first door is open, in which case it will open on each knock independently with probability $p\_2$. We solve this problem almost completely by identifying algorithms that are optimal up to an additive term of 1."

It's also helpful to ask people to speak clearly and slowly, and to repeat what they said to ensure you understand. Don't be afraid to ask for clarification or to say ""excuse me, can you repeat that?""

Another thing that has worked for me is to use visual aids like lip-reading or reading lips. It's not always easy, but it's a skill that can be developed with practice. You can also try to find a quiet spot to talk, away from background noise, which can make it easier to hear and understand.

I've also learned to be more patient with myself and others. It's not always easy to understand someone right away, and it's okay to take a little extra time to process what's being said. And remember, it's not about being embarrassed or ashamed - it's about finding ways to communicate effectively and build strong relationships.

I hope these suggestions help you feel more confident and comfortable in public places. Remember, you're not alone, and there are many people who have learned to cope with hearing difficulties. Keep being social and don't let this hold you back!

As you continue to work on your hearing, don't forget to take care of your overall health and well-being. Get plenty of rest, eat nutritious food, and engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. These habits can help improve your overall health and reduce stress, which can also impact your hearing.

Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. You got this, and you're capable of overcoming any challenges that come your way."," say I'm about 50% deaf in the ear, basically all sound from it is extremely muffled, as if it was stuffed with cotton, and I can hear certain tone ranges, and others will be blocked out, I can hear highs and lows ok, but mid range notes are pretty well blocked out, and that tends to be where most peoples voices fall.

Anyways, I've learned to just cope with this by learning to read the situation. If someone is making small talk that they just want me to listen to, then I use the smile and nod with an occasional ""Uh huh!"", and pick up the gist of what they are saying through the various bits of the sentence I can properly hear. I do this now almost subconsciously, and I've become VERY good at putting together the general message they are trying to convey, even though I hear probably 50% of it. I'm also VERY in tune with body language. So much of conversation is unspoken, if you can learn to trust your instinct with the body language and even gather bits and pieces of a conversation you would be amazed at how well people think you are listening. Most people say I'm one of the best listeners they have ever talked to, but really half of what they are saying I don't hear, so the other half I intently focus on, and I basically pantomime their body langue back at them, it really gives a great impression of empathy, and I just use canned responses in combination, to come off as understanding.

In those circumstances where the conversation warrants a back and forth I just do the best I can. If I can't understand them I simply say ""Sorry, I can't hear you can you repeat that?"". If I have to ask more than twice I explain that my hearing is unfortunately not that great, and almost everyone has been very understanding. Some people laugh at me when I explain why my hearing is sub-par, and then I ask them what is funny about the situation, and move on to a better person who isn't going to judge me over what I perceive as a very, very small inconvenience to them.
[deleted]: Ok thanks, I'll try to read body language. But I already do the ""Uh-uh"" smile, etc. thing and I end up agreeing or laughing if it's a joke that I didn't even understand what they said. Sometimes one of my ears goes a little deaf but it comes back after a couple of minutes. It happens with either my left or right. I'll still go see a professional and see what it might be.

Pelusteriano: Ah, great question! The green sour lemons are actually a type of lime, not a lemon. They're commonly known as Key limes, and they're native to the Florida Keys and the Caribbean. They're smaller and more acidic than regular limes, with a more intense flavor. You can find them in most supermarkets, especially in areas with a large Latin American population.

Isai76: Yeah, Key limes are a staple in Mexican cuisine, especially in the Yucatan region. We use them to make all sorts of dishes, from guacamole to ceviche. And of course, they're a key ingredient in our famous lime soup, which is a family recipe passed down from generation to generation.

cleej112: That sounds amazing! I've never had lime soup before, but I'm definitely going to have to try it. Do you have any other favorite Mexican dishes?

Pelusteriano: Oh, absolutely! I'm a big fan of tacos al pastor, which are basically tacos filled with marinated pork cooked on a vertical spit. And of course, you can't go wrong with a classic carne asada, which is grilled steak served with fresh cilantro and onions. But let's be real, the best part of any Mexican meal is the dessert. I mean, have you ever tried churros with a side of chocolate sauce? It's like a little piece of heaven in your mouth.

lagoon83: Mmm, that sounds incredible! I've always loved churros, but I've never had them with chocolate sauce before. Do you have any other favorite desserts?

Pelusteriano: Yeah, I'm a big fan of tres leches cake, which is basically a sponge cake soaked in three types of milk (evaporated milk, condensed milk, and heavy cream). It's so moist and delicious, and it's perfect for special occasions. And of course, no Mexican celebration would be complete without a big ol' bowl of arroz con leche, which is basically a rice pudding flavored with cinnamon and vanilla. It's comfort food at its finest.

Isai76: Yeah, Mexican desserts are the best! And don't even get me started on the importance of coffee in our culture. I mean, a good cup of coffee is the perfect way to start the day, and it's always a staple at family gatherings and celebrations.

cleej112: That's so true! I've always loved the strong, rich flavor of Mexican coffee. Do you have any favorite coffee shops or roasters?

Pelusteriano: Actually, I'm a big fan of a local roaster here in my hometown. They source their beans from small-scale farmers in Chiapas, and they roast them in-house using a traditional method. The result is a coffee that's full of flavor and complexity, with notes of chocolate and caramel. It's the perfect way to start the day, especially with a slice of pan dulce on the side.

Interestingly, I'd always thought the green sour lemons were what we'd call limes... but now I'm not so sure! I've definitely seen them sold as limes in supermarkets - they're smaller, darker and more round than the limes you linked to. I'm gonna have to investigate this further :)

This new model is based on a set of equations that take into account the main factors that influence indoor daylighting, such as the orientation and size of the windows, the reflectance of the interior surfaces, and the amount of daylight that enters the room.

The model is tested using a set of case studies, including a office building and a residential building, and the results are compared with those obtained using other models. The results show that the new model provides more accurate predictions of indoor daylighting values than the other models, and that it is able to take into account the complex interactions between the different factors that influence indoor daylighting. The model is also able to predict the effects of different design and construction options on indoor daylighting, such as the use of different types of glazing and the installation of daylighting devices.

In conclusion, the new model presented in this paper is a significant improvement over existing models for determining indoor daylighting values.

    Furthermore, carrying a rifle in public is not only a safety concern for the carrier, but also for the innocent bystanders who may be caught in the crossfire of a potential confrontation.  It's a reckless and irresponsible act that can have devastating consequences.

    Instead of resorting to such drastic measures, gun owners and advocates should focus on educating the public about the importance of responsible gun ownership and the benefits of gun control.  They should work with lawmakers to pass legislation that promotes public safety and responsible gun ownership.

    By doing so, gun owners can demonstrate their commitment to responsible gun ownership and their desire to work towards a safer and more responsible gun culture.  This approach will help to build trust and credibility with the public, and will ultimately help to advance the cause of gun rights.

The importance of traceability in supply chain logistics management cannot be overstated. It allows companies to monitor the movement of products from the raw material stage to the final product, ensuring that the product meets the required quality standards. With the help of traceability, companies can identify and address any issues that may arise during the production process, reducing the risk of product recalls and improving customer satisfaction. Additionally, traceability enables companies to track the origin of raw materials, ensuring that they comply with regulatory requirements and maintain a high level of quality control.

In today's digital age, technology plays a crucial role in supply chain logistics management. The use of blockchain technology, for instance, can help companies to create a secure and transparent record of product movement, ensuring that all stakeholders have access to the same information. This can help to build trust and credibility among stakeholders, improving the overall efficiency of the supply chain. Furthermore, the use of data analytics can help companies to identify trends and patterns in the supply chain, enabling them to make data-driven decisions and optimize their operations.

Effective supply chain logistics management is critical for companies to remain competitive in the market. It requires a combination of strategic planning, operational efficiency, and technological innovation. By implementing traceability and leveraging technology, companies can improve the visibility and transparency of their supply chain, reducing the risk of errors and improving customer satisfaction. In conclusion, the importance of supply chain logistics management cannot be overstated, and companies must prioritize it to remain competitive in the market."," and downstream at each point.

To overcome these limitations, a new approach is needed that allows for efficient and modular parsing of context-free grammars with declarative disambiguation rules. One possible solution is to use a hybrid parsing technique that combines the benefits of top-down and bottom-up parsing. This approach would enable the parser to take advantage of the declarative disambiguation rules to disambiguate the input, while still maintaining a high parsing performance.

Another potential solution is to use a parsing technique that is specifically designed for parsing context-free grammars with declarative disambiguation rules. For example, a parser that uses a combination of recursive descent parsing and operator precedence parsing could be used to parse the grammar efficiently and accurately. This approach would allow the parser to take advantage of the declarative disambiguation rules to disambiguate the input, while still maintaining a high parsing performance.

In addition to these technical solutions, it is also important to consider the impact of declarative disambiguation on the grammar itself. For example, the use of declarative disambiguation rules can make the grammar more concise and easier to maintain, but it can also make it more difficult to understand and debug. Therefore, it is important to strike a balance between the benefits of declarative disambiguation and the potential drawbacks, and to carefully consider the trade-offs when designing a grammar with declarative disambiguation rules.

Overall, the implementation of support for declarative disambiguation within a parser is a complex task that requires careful consideration of the technical and practical implications. By using a combination of hybrid parsing techniques and declarative disambiguation rules, it is possible to create a parser that is both efficient and modular, and that can accurately parse context-free grammars with declarative disambiguation rules."," grammar fragments of potentially different languages). The latter subject is generally addressed by scannerless generalized parsers. We aim to equip scannerless generalized parsers with novel disambiguation methods that are inherently performant, without compromising the concerns of modularity and language composition. **Approach** In this paper, we present a novel low-overhead implementation technique for disambiguating deep associativity and priority conflicts in scannerless generalized parsers with lightweight data-dependency. **Knowledge** Ambiguities with respect to operator precedence and associativity arise from combining the various operators of a language. While *shallow conflicts* can be resolved efficiently by one-level tree patterns, *deep conflicts* require more elaborate techniques, because they can occur arbitrarily nested in a tree. Current state-of-the-art approaches to solving deep priority conflicts come with a severe performance overhead. **Grounding** We evaluated our new approach against state-of-the-art declarative disambiguation mechanisms. By parsing a corpus of popular open-source repositories written in Java and OCaml, we found that our approach yields speedups of up to 1.73x over a grammar rewriting technique when parsing programs with deep priority conflicts--with a modest overhead of 1-2 % when parsing programs without deep conflicts. **Importance** A recent empirical study shows that deep priority conflicts are indeed wide-spread in real-world programs. The study shows that in a corpus of popular OCaml projects on Github, up to 17 % of the source files contain deep priority conflicts. However, there is no solution in the literature that addresses efficient disambiguation of deep priority conflicts, with support for modular and composable syntax definitions."

...random jobs just to make ends meet, often without any relation to their field of study. This can lead to a sense of purposelessness and dissatisfaction. Moreover, the burden of student loan debt only adds to the stress and anxiety of this situation. It's as if the entire system is designed to churn out graduates who are ill-prepared for the workforce and deeply in debt.

Furthermore, the emphasis on college as a means to secure a high-paying job has led to a widening gap between the haves and have-nots. Those who can afford to attend top-tier colleges and universities are given a significant advantage in the job market, while those who cannot afford it are left behind. This perpetuates social and economic inequality, and it's a problem that needs to be addressed.

In my opinion, we need to rethink the purpose of college and the role it plays in our society. Rather than viewing it as a means to secure a job, we should see it as an opportunity for personal growth, intellectual exploration, and skill-building. We should focus on creating a system that values and rewards critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving, rather than just credentials.

Additionally, we need to address the issue of for-profit colleges and their predatory practices. These institutions are preying on vulnerable students who are desperate for a way out of poverty or seeking to improve their economic prospects. We need to hold these institutions accountable and ensure that they are providing a quality education that prepares students for success, rather than just lining their own pockets.

Ultimately, the world might be better off without college for everyone. Instead, we should focus on creating a system that values and rewards skills, knowledge, and personal growth, regardless of whether or not someone has a college degree. This would allow us to create a more equitable and just society, where everyone has the opportunity to succeed and thrive, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status."," jobs that can’t conceivably pay off their loans.

I’ve long argued for degrees to be dispersed at cheaper costs, under the community college model
FyodorToastoevsky: College has a lot of merit, but it absolutely shouldn't be a requirement for most jobs, much less entry-level, nonprofessional jobs. I think there are good reasons someone should go to college: if you want a professional degree (doctor, lawyer, etc), if you want to go into academia, if you just want to learn more... 

The community college model is probably a better alternative, as are trade and vocational schools, since those lead to good, stable careers which are necessary for society. But our culture looks down on those jobs, so we tell people to go to college, and colleges love it because they can make more money. 

The fact that we think of college as worthless apart from networking (not to pick on you, because this is a fairly common viewpoint) is a result of devaluing college education by telling everyone to do it. If someone goes to an expensive but low-tier college, skips all their classes, majors in something they don't really care about, and then finds out that they've graduated in debt, jobless, and having gained nothing from the experience except a few friends, *of course* they're going to think college is a pointless exercise in networking, because for them that's what it was. 

I sympathize with people who want college to be free or who want everyone to go, because they want everyone to have more opportunities, but the fact is there are so many good jobs that are understaffed because we don't encourage people to do them. Electricians, plumbers, and other blue-collar professions are so important and it's awful that we don't treat them as such. 
jurmyhyle: Money is the reason why.  “We” don’t tell kids to go to college.  “We” don’t tell kids to not learn a trade.  There is a huge profit incentive from school admins and such to keep the college culture going simply because they’re making a killing from gullible kids.

These nonlocal models can take into account the interactions between the material's microstructure and the flow field, allowing for a more accurate prediction of the material's behavior. For example, the use of multiphase lattice Boltzmann methods has been shown to be effective in simulating the flow of complex fluids, such as suspensions and emulsions. These methods can capture the complex interactions between the different phases and the flow field, allowing for a more detailed understanding of the material's behavior.

In addition to the use of nonlocal models, the development of new experimental techniques has also been important in advancing our understanding of the flow behavior of complex fluids. For example, the use of particle image velocimetry (PIV) and other optical techniques has allowed researchers to measure the velocity fields of complex fluids with high spatial and temporal resolution. This has enabled the study of the flow behavior of complex fluids under a wide range of conditions, and has led to the discovery of new complex behaviors that were not previously observed.

Overall, the study of the flow behavior of complex fluids is an active area of research, with many new and exciting developments taking place. The use of nonlocal models and advanced experimental techniques has opened up new avenues for the study of these materials, and has led to a deeper understanding of their complex behavior. As research continues to advance, it is likely that we will see even more complex and fascinating behaviors emerge, and new opportunities for the application of these materials in a wide range of fields.",". Doubt may then be cast on any macroscopic characterization of such systems, and one may wonder if any material behaves in some conditions as a Herschel-Bulkley material. In this paper, we address the question of the existence of a simple yield stress fluid behavior. We first review experimental results from the literature and we point out the main factors (physical properties, experimental procedure) at the origin of flow inhomogeneities and nonlocal effects. It leads us to propose a well-defined procedure to ensure that steady-state bulk properties of the materials are studied. We use this procedure to investigate yield stress fluid flows with MRI techniques. We focus on nonthixotropic dense suspensions of soft particles (foams, concentrated emulsions, Carbopol gels). We show that, as long as they are studied in a wide (as compared to the size of the material mesoscopic elements) gap geometry, these materials behave as 'simple yield stress fluids': they are homogeneous, they do not exhibit steady-state shear banding, and their steady flow behavior in simple shear can be modeled by a local continuous monotonic constitutive equation which accounts for flows in various conditions and matches the macroscopic response."
sad,id986,human," to the probabilistic logic to make it more suitable for common sense reasoning.

One of the main challenges in applying probabilistic logic to common sense reasoning is dealing with inconsistent or incomplete information. In the examples mentioned earlier, we have inconsistent information, such as Dick being a Quaker and a Republican, or Tweety being a bird and a penguin. In traditional probabilistic logic, such inconsistencies would lead to contradictions and inconsistent probability assignments. However, in common sense reasoning, we often have to deal with incomplete or uncertain information, and it is not always possible to establish consistency.

To address this issue, we propose a new probabilistic logic that allows for inconsistent or incomplete information. We call this logic ""probabilistic fuzzy logic"". In probabilistic fuzzy logic, we assign fuzzy truth values to logical propositions, which are represented as membership functions in the unit interval [0,1]. This allows us to represent inconsistent or incomplete information in a more flexible way.

For example, in the case of Dick being a Quaker and a Republican, we can assign a fuzzy truth value of 0.8 to the proposition ""Dick is a Quaker"" and a fuzzy truth value of 0.2 to the proposition ""Dick is a Republican"". This represents our uncertainty about Dick's membership in these two groups. Similarly, in the case of Tweety being a bird and a penguin, we can assign a fuzzy truth value of 0.5 to the proposition ""Tweety is a bird"" and a fuzzy truth value of 0.5 to the proposition ""Tweety is a penguin"", representing our uncertainty about Tweety's species.

In probabilistic fuzzy logic, we use fuzzy inference rules to combine the fuzzy truth values of different propositions. These rules are based on fuzzy set theory and allow us to represent complex relationships between propositions. For example, we can use the fuzzy inference rule ""If Dick is a Quaker and Quakers are pacifists, then Dick is a pacifist"" to combine the fuzzy truth values of the propositions ""Dick is a Quaker"" and ""Quakers are pacifists"" and obtain a fuzzy truth value for the proposition ""Dick is a pacifist"".

We also propose a new probabilistic inference scheme that takes into account the fuzzy truth values of propositions. This scheme is based on the idea of fuzzy probability theory and allows us to calculate the probability of a proposition given a set of fuzzy truth values. This scheme is more robust than traditional probabilistic inference schemes and can handle inconsistent or incomplete information.

In conclusion, we propose a new probabilistic logic that allows for inconsistent or incomplete information and is more suitable for common sense reasoning. We call this logic ""probabilistic fuzzy logic"" and use fuzzy truth values and fuzzy inference rules to represent complex relationships between propositions. We also propose a new probabilistic inference scheme that takes into account the fuzzy truth values of propositions and is more robust than traditional probabilistic inference schemes."," of the probabilistic logic. In the second section, we shall consider the space of all interpretations, consistent or not. In terms of frames of discernment, the basic probability assignment (bpa) and belief function can be defined. Dempster's combination rule is applicable. This extension of probabilistic logic is called the evidential logic in [ 1]. For each proposition s, its belief function is represented by an interval [Spt(s), Pls(s)]. When all such intervals collapse to single points, the evidential logic reduces to probabilistic logic (in the generalized version of not necessarily consistent interpretations). Certainly, we get Nilsson's probabilistic logic by further restricting to consistent interpretations. In the third section, we shall give a probabilistic interpretation of probabilistic logic in terms of multi-dimensional random variables. This interpretation brings the probabilistic logic into the framework of probability theory. Let us consider a finite set S = {sl, s2, ..., Sn) of logical propositions. Each proposition may have true or false values; and may be considered as a random variable. We have a probability distribution for each proposition. The e-dimensional random variable (sl,..., Sn) may take values in the space of all interpretations of 2n binary vectors. We may compute absolute (marginal), conditional and joint probability distributions. It turns out that the permissible probabilistic interpretation vector of Nilsson [12] consists of the joint probabilities of S. Inconsistent interpretations will not appear, by setting their joint probabilities to be zeros. By summing appropriate joint probabilities, we get probabilities of individual propositions or subsets of propositions. Since the Bayes formula and other techniques are valid for e-dimensional random variables, the probabilistic logic is actually very close to the Bayesian inference schemes. In the last section, we shall consider a relaxation scheme for probabilistic logic. In this system, not only new evidences will update the belief measures of a collection of propositions, but also constraint satisfaction among these propositions in the relational network will revise these measures. This mechanism is similar to human reasoning which is an evaluative process converging to the most satisfactory result. The main idea arises from the consistent labeling problem in computer vision. This method is originally applied to scene analysis of line drawings. Later, it is applied to matching, constraint satisfaction and multi sensor fusion by several authors [8], [16] (and see references cited there). Recently, this method is used in knowledge aggregation by Landy and Hummel [9]."

As a result, there is a growing need for efficient and effective debugging tools that can handle the complexities of IoT systems. One potential solution is to develop online debuggers that can provide real-time feedback and debugging capabilities. Online debuggers can be designed to work in conjunction with IoT devices, allowing developers to monitor and debug their applications in real-time. This can significantly reduce the time and effort required for debugging, and enable developers to quickly identify and resolve issues.

Another approach is to leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to develop intelligent debugging tools. These tools can be trained to recognize patterns and anomalies in IoT data, and provide developers with insights and recommendations for debugging and troubleshooting. For example, AI-powered debugging tools can be used to identify potential issues before they occur, and provide developers with predictive maintenance and troubleshooting capabilities.

In addition to these approaches, there is also a need for standardized debugging protocols and interfaces for IoT systems. This can help to ensure that debugging tools and techniques are compatible and interoperable across different IoT platforms and devices. Standardized debugging protocols can also help to facilitate the development of new debugging tools and techniques, and enable developers to share knowledge and expertise across different industries and domains.

In conclusion, debugging is a significant challenge in IoT system development, and there is a growing need for efficient and effective debugging tools and techniques. Online debuggers, intelligent debugging tools, and standardized debugging protocols are just a few examples of the approaches that can be used to address this challenge. By developing and deploying these tools and techniques, developers can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their debugging processes, and ensure the successful development and deployment of IoT systems."," might miss contextual information relevant to find the root cause of bugs. On the other hand, online debuggers do allow debugging a program upon a failure while providing contextual information (e.g., stack trace). In particular, remote online debuggers enable debugging of devices without physical access to them. However, they experience debugging interference due to network delays which complicates bug reproducibility, and have limited support for dynamic software updates on remote devices. Approach: This paper proposes out-of-things debugging, an online debugging approach especially designed for IoT systems. The debugger is always-on as it ensures constant availability to for instance debug post-deployment situations. Upon a failure or breakpoint, out-of-things debugging moves the state of a deployed application to the developer's machine. Developers can then debug the application locally by applying operations (e.g., step commands) to the retrieved state. Once debugging is finished, developers can commit bug fixes to the device through live update capabilities. Finally, by means of a fine-grained flexible interface for accessing remote resources, developers have full control over the debugging overhead imposed on the device, and the access to device hardware resources (e.g., sensors) needed during local debugging. Knowledge: Out-of-things debugging maintains good properties of remote debugging as it does not require physical access to the device to debug it, while reducing debugging interference since there are no network delays on operations (e.g., stepping) issued on the debugger since those happen locally. Furthermore, device resources are only accessed when requested by the user which further mitigates overhead and opens avenues for mocking or simulation of non-accessed resources. Grounding: We implemented an out-of-things debugger as an extension to a WebAssembly Virtual Machine and benchmarked its suitability for IoT. In particular, we compared our solution to remote debugging alternatives based on metrics such as network overhead, memory usage, scalability, and usability in production settings. From the benchmarks, we conclude that our debugger exhibits competitive performance in addition to confining overhead without sacrificing debugging convenience and flexibility. Importance: Out-of-things debugging enables debugging of IoT systems by means of classical online operations (e.g., stepwise execution) while addressing IoT-specific concerns (e.g., hardware limitations). We show that having the debugger always-on does not have to come at cost of performance loss or increased overhead but instead can enforce a smooth-going and flexible debugging experience of IoT systems."

The figure shows a clear trend of increasing modal loss factor with increasing frequency, which is consistent with the expected behavior.

Furthermore, we also investigated the effect of the soundboard's internal structure on the mechanical mobility. We found that the presence of internal structures such as bridges and ribs has a significant impact on the mobility, particularly at higher frequencies. The internal structures cause the soundboard to behave like a more complex system, with multiple modes and resonances. This complexity can be seen in the measured mobility data, which shows a more detailed structure than the simple homogeneous plate model would predict.

In addition to the experimental measurements, we also performed numerical simulations using a finite element model of the soundboard. The simulations were used to validate the experimental results and to provide additional insight into the behavior of the soundboard. The simulations showed good agreement with the experimental results, and provided a detailed understanding of the soundboard's internal mechanics. The results of the simulations are presented in Fig. 2, which shows the calculated modal loss factor as a function of frequency. The figure shows a similar trend to the experimental data, with a clear increase in modal loss factor with increasing frequency.

The measurements could be done up to 2.5 kHz, with a novel high-resolution modal analysis technique (see the ICA companion-paper, Ege and Boutillon (2010)). Above 1.1 kHz, the change in the observed modal density together with numerical simulations confirm Berthaut's finding that the waves in the soundboard are confined between adjacent ribs (Berthaut et al. 2003). Extending the Skudrzyk and Langley approaches, we synthesize the mechanical mobility at the bridge up to 2.5 kHz. The validity of the computation for an extended spectral domain is discussed. It is also shown that the evolution of the modal density with frequency is consistent with the rise of mobility (fall of impedance) in this frequency range and that both are due to the inter-rib effect appearing when the half-wavelength becomes equal to the rib spacing. Results match previous observations by Wogram (1980), Conklin (1996), Giordano (1998), Nakamura (1983) and could be used for numerical simulations for example. This approach avoids the detailed description of the soundboard, based on a very high number of parameters. However, it can be used to predict the changes of the driving point mobility, and possibly of the sound radiation in the treble range, resulting from structural modifications."

The FE model is developed by discretizing the breast into a mesh of small elements, each representing a specific region of the breast. The material properties of the breast tissue, such as its density and stiffness, are assigned to each element. The compression process is simulated by applying a uniform pressure to the breast, which causes the elements to deform and change shape. The resulting deformation is then used to compute the stress and strain distributions within the breast tissue.

The FE model is validated by comparing the simulated results with experimental data obtained from a physical phantom breast. The phantom breast is made of a material that mimics the properties of human breast tissue and is compressed using a device that simulates the mammography compression process. The resulting images are then compared with the simulated images obtained from the FE model to evaluate the accuracy of the model.

The results of the study show that the FE model is able to accurately simulate the behavior of the breast during compression and predict the resulting stress and strain distributions. The model is also able to identify the optimal compression strategy that minimizes the radiation dose while maintaining good image quality.

Previously developed biomechanical breast models use a simplified breast anatomy by modeling adipose and fibroglandular tissues only (Rajagopal et al. in Wiley Interdiscip Rev: Syst Biol Med 2:293--304, 2010). However, breast reconstruction surgery has proven the importance of suspensory ligaments and breast fasciae on breast mechanics (Lockwood in Plast Reconstr Surg 103:1411--1420, 1999). We are therefore consider using a more realistic breast anatomy by including skin, muscles, and suspensory ligaments. The breast tissues are modeled as neo-Hookean materials. A physical correct modeling of the breast requires the knowledge of the stress-free breast configuration. Here, this undeformed shape (i.e., without any residual stress) is computed using the prediction--correction iterative scheme proposed by Eiben et al. (Ann of Biomed Eng 44:154--173, 2016). The unloading procedure uses the breast configuration in prone and supine position in order to find a unique displacement vector field induced by gravitational forces. The 3D breast geometry is reconstructed from MRI images that are segmented (Yushkevich et al. in Neuroimage 31:1116--1128, 2006) to differentiate the four main tissue types. The breast volume is discretized with a hexa-dominant FE meshing tool as a unique volume.

guitarlisa: Yeah, it's not just the kids who are at risk. I've seen adults get hurt on trampolines too. In fact, I know someone who broke their ankle jumping on a trampoline during a birthday party. It's just not worth the risk, in my opinion.

HeaviestEyelidsEver: I understand your concerns, but I still think it's important to take precautions. For example, you could install a net or padding around the trampoline to help cushion falls. You could also make sure the kids are supervised at all times and teach them how to jump safely.

The_Incredulous_Hulk: Yeah, and you should also make sure the trampoline is installed correctly and is in good condition. I've seen some trampolines that are just begging to be a hazard.

Shuetzenhoeffer: That's a great point. Trampolines can be a lot of fun, but they do require some maintenance and attention to safety. If you're not willing to put in the effort to ensure the trampoline is safe, then maybe you shouldn't have one at all.

EchoRex: Absolutely. Safety should always be the top priority, especially when it comes to kids. It's better to err on the side of caution and avoid the risk of injury altogether.

guitarlisa: I think that's a great way to look at it. And it's not just about the physical injuries, either. Emotional trauma can be just as devastating as a broken bone. If you're not careful, a trampoline accident could leave a child with lasting emotional scars.

HeaviestEyelidsEver: That's a great point. It's not just about the physical safety, but also the emotional well-being of the kids. We should always prioritize their safety and well-being above all else.

The_Incredulous_Hulk: Yeah, and it's not just about the kids, either. As adults, we have a responsibility to ensure that our kids are safe and healthy. If we're not willing to take the necessary steps to ensure their safety, then we're failing as parents.

Shuetzenhoeffer: I couldn't agree more. As parents, it's our job to protect our kids and keep them safe. And that includes being mindful of the risks associated with trampolines and taking steps to mitigate those risks.

EchoRex: Absolutely. It's not just about having fun, it's about being responsible and putting the safety of our kids first.

[deleted]: I'm not sure you can expect a 2 year old to have situational awareness if they have never encountered a trampoline which is plausible given the age. I'm ruling this one in favor of the toddler and I find the parents at fault here. I'm giving 10% of the blame to the kids on the trampoline for not noticing the kid coming towards them but again, kids so they don't pay attention hence the only 10%. 
rice5259: Still bad situational awareness from the kid. Ignorance is never an excuse!
[deleted]: Yes, in this case seeing as how the child is two ignorance is am excuse. Remember when you were 2? No you do not. Wait til you have a 2 year old, they aren't very intelligent.
rice5259: It is *never* an excuse.
[deleted]: Yea putting it in italics doesn't magically make it more true. Go grab your nearest 2 year old and watch them do some of the dumbest things you've ever seen regardless of the obviousness of how harmful what they are doing is. Situational awareness requires knowledge that what they are walking into can hurt them. 24 months of life is nowhere near enough to get that kind of experience down so yes, this kid is not at fault for being ignorant and it is indeed a great excuse that can and will be used here. 
rice5259: Whatever you write will never change the **fact** that ignorance is *never an excuse*. Grow up and stop acting like a 2 year old.
[deleted]: Aren't you just so clever! Sadly typing it in bold doesn't make it any more true either. Sorry kid. 
rice5259: Luckily facts don't care what **you** say, buddy.
[deleted]: I'm not your buddy pal! Also waiting a week and putting words in bold stilled doesn't make you correct. You're still wrong but I'll keep telling you as long as you feel like continuing to prove it.
rice5259: Alright kid, whatever you say.
[deleted]: Seriously what could posses you to say a 2 year old child should have common sense about an object they have never encountered? I also appreciate your ""kid"" comment. Makes me feel young again.
rice5259: Let me tell you that the irony in having to explain something like this to you isn't [lost on me](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=define%3A+instinct)

As Feynt mentioned, the story behind the law is rooted in the history of landlord-tenant relationships. In the past, landlords had more control over their properties and tenants were often seen as mere renters rather than homeowners. This led to a lack of privacy and security for tenants, who were often subject to surprise visits from their landlords. The tenant lock was introduced as a way to address this issue and provide tenants with a sense of security and control over their living spaces.

The tenant lock is a simple but effective solution to this problem. By providing a second deadbolt that can only be accessed from the inside, tenants can ensure that their landlords cannot enter their apartments without permission. This not only provides a sense of security but also gives tenants a sense of control over their living spaces.

In addition to providing a sense of security and control, the tenant lock also helps to promote a sense of community and respect between landlords and tenants. By providing a secure and private living space, landlords are showing that they respect the privacy and security of their tenants. This can help to build trust and foster a positive relationship between landlords and tenants.

The tenant lock is not just limited to Texas, however. Many cities and states have similar laws and regulations in place to protect the privacy and security of tenants. For example, in New York City, landlords are required to provide tenants with a certain level of privacy and security, including the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.

cflatjazz: I negotiated a 24 hour notice period with my TX landlord for this very reason. It's his property, yes, but I preferred some notice before having someone come muck about in the middle of my things. So he just gives me heads up if he needs to come by for his biannual maintenance. It's suited us very well so far, and IIRC the language provides an exception for emergency maintenance (fire, broken pipes while we're on vacation, etc). 

I'm not sure how fast it would hold in a court, but was worth the knowledge that he could be reasonable and compromise up front.
gianni_: Unlike the person you replied to, legally in Ontario, Canada, landlords have to give written notice, I believe of 24 hours, that they will be entering an apartment
kevin_the_dolphoodle: Same in California unless it’s an emergency. California has extremely strong tenant rights though
FunWithOnions: Thank god.  With how expensive it is to live here, we need renters protection against greedy landlords.
kevin_the_dolphoodle: It’s definitely good to have these protections. I own a home that I used to rent out. I gave the tenants 120 days notice to move out. I was legally obliged to give them 60, but I wanted to give them as much time as possible to find a new living situation. In the end I had to evict them and they totally took advantage of me. I do not have much extra money, and they decided to try and financially ruin me for “kicking them out of their home”. It can be a double edged sword for sure
aethelmund: I've read one of the better ways of dealing with this kind of thing is paying them to get the fuck out of your property, usually they take the cash rather that living for a couple months rent free
kevin_the_dolphoodle: I know that kind of thing happens in San Francisco all the time. My brother, who was already planning on leaving, offered to leave for 50k. They offered 25k. My brother moved the same time he was planning on moving with 25k. For clarification, he was renting a rent-controlled place in the mission in SF. He had been there for 15 years and was paying 25-30% what it could have been bringing in
aethelmund: Like he wasn't paying rent and refused to leave? That's kinda shitty if that's the case
ZippyTheRobin: Comment you replied to described a ""rent controlled"" apartment, meaning the landlord can only raise the rent on a tenant at a specified, regulated rate (to prevent residents being forced out of their homes by rising rents in hypercompetitive markets such as the SF bay area). The commenter's brother offered to leave the apartment (giving up his legally given rent controlled status in exchange for the landlord buying him out) so the landlord could rent it out at current market rates.
aethelmund: AH that makes more sense now, I get it. Basically both parties knew that the place could be rented for more but the landlord couldn't charge him the market rate cause of rent control so the tenet and landlord agreed to a buy out, that's kinda cool actually, instead of having a shitty landlord and/or tenet they worked things out appropriately

I've tried to troubleshoot the problem, but it seems that no matter what I do, the GPS still insists on giving me incorrect directions. I've updated the software, deleted the cache, and even tried using a different GPS device, but nothing seems to work. It's like the device has a mind of its own and is determined to get me lost.

Despite the frustration, I still find myself relying on my GPS from time to time. Maybe it's because I'm lazy, or maybe it's because I'm just not good at reading maps. Whatever the reason, I know that I'm not alone in my struggles with GPS devices.

In fact, many people have reported similar problems with their GPS devices. Some have even gone so far as to call them ""fatally misleading travel companions."" I can see why. When you're relying on a device to get you from point A to point B, it's not exactly reassuring to know that it's not always accurate.

Despite the challenges, I'm still hopeful that GPS technology will continue to improve. Maybe one day we'll have devices that are more reliable, more accurate, and easier to use. Until then, I'll just have to keep relying on my trusty atlas and my own sense of direction.

As I continue to navigate the roads, I'll be keeping an eye out for any new developments in GPS technology. Who knows, maybe one day we'll have devices that are more like personal assistants, able to anticipate our needs and provide us with the most efficient routes. Until then, I'll just have to keep on trucking, and hope that my GPS doesn't get me lost again.

In the meantime, I'll be sharing my experiences with others, in the hopes that they'll be able to learn from my mistakes.

If you have a Tom-Tom or similar, I'm afraid I can't help you due to an utter lack of experience.
WiretapStudios: I updated the 2010 maps with the 2011 ones already :(   It's a Garmin.  It doesn't say bear left, when there are areas where the interstate has a road split off (for example) but the same interstate number still goes straight, it says a turn is coming up.  So for example, if I take I-81 north through several states, it lists the directions as having several, 'turns' when in reality, I'm just staying on the exact same road.

Otherwise, the Garmin has been pretty good in other aspects, it's not a complete waste of time to use, but sometimes it goes get a bit squirrely.  
finalremix: Yeah, mine does that, too, actually... I think it's just a weird way that they have it set up to treat highways... In the software on PC, the map is divvied up into chunks, like in the game Minecraft... I'm thinking those usually occur on or near the edges of chunks and it's programmed to make sure you're staying on that road, instead of just tossing up a ""go straight for eight. hundred miles. Then take exit 23 on right.""

I know mine goes *batshit insane* in a city, though... 

Save for the ones hardwired into a car that runs off of a compass and the spedometer, I haven't seen a sat-nav not freak out in skyscraper canyons...
WiretapStudios: Mine hasn't been too bad in the city, but it's not like I've been in Manhattan with it, mostly DC, Baltimore, etc.  The problem with the interstate turn thing is that it does two things:

1. It says time to next turn is x.  But there is no turn, so it makes that feature not that helpful.

2. It says there is a left turn ahead, I hustle to get in the left lane, and there is no turn to take.

Overall though I don't mind it too much, it just does weird shit sometimes.

sad,id987,human," a more comprehensive and adaptive framework that can handle the dynamic nature of real-world problems.

One potential approach to addressing this gap is to develop a hybrid framework that combines elements of both probability and uncertainty theories. This could involve using probability theory to provide a basic structure for representing knowledge, and then using uncertainty theories to provide a more flexible and adaptive framework for updating and refining that knowledge. This would allow Al systems to dynamically add and remove parts of the knowledge structure as needed, while still providing a robust and reliable foundation for decision-making.

Another potential approach is to develop new uncertainty theories that are specifically designed to address the needs of Al research. This could involve developing new mathematical frameworks for representing and manipulating uncertainty, or developing new algorithms and techniques for updating and refining uncertain knowledge. This would require a deep understanding of the underlying principles of uncertainty and probability, as well as a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science.

In addition to these theoretical approaches, there are also practical considerations that must be taken into account when developing Al systems that can handle uncertainty. For example, Al systems must be able to handle noisy and incomplete data, and must be able to adapt to changing circumstances and new information. This requires a deep understanding of the underlying principles of uncertainty and probability, as well as a strong foundation in computer science and engineering.

Overall, the need for a more comprehensive and adaptive framework for handling uncertainty in Al research is clear. By developing new theories, algorithms, and techniques for representing and manipulating uncertainty, Al researchers can create more robust and reliable systems that can handle the complex and dynamic nature of real-world problems."," systems which stress ease of use and don't require extensive probability information when one cannot (or doesn't wish to) provide such information. This paper attempts to help reconcile the gap between approaches to uncertainty and the needs of many AI systems by examining the control issues which arise, independent of a particular uncertainty calculus. when one tries to satisfy these needs. Truth Maintenance Systems have been used extensively in problem solving tasks to help organize a set of facts and detect inconsistencies in the believed state of the world. These systems maintain a set of true/false propositions and their associated dependencies. However, situations often arise in which we are unsure of certain facts or in which the conclusions we can draw from available information are somewhat uncertain. The non-monotonic TMS 12] was an attempt at reasoning when all the facts are not known, but it fails to take into account degrees of belief and how available evidence can combine to strengthen a particular belief. This paper addresses the problem of probabilistic reasoning as it applies to Truth Maintenance Systems. It describes a belief Maintenance System that manages a current set of beliefs in much the same way that a TMS manages a set of true/false propositions. If the system knows that belief in fact is dependent in some way upon belief in fact2, then it automatically modifies its belief in facts when new information causes a change in belief of fact2. It models the behavior of a TMS, replacing its 3-valued logic (true, false, unknown) with an infinite valued logic, in such a way as to reduce to a standard TMS if all statements are given in absolute true/false terms. Belief Maintenance Systems can, therefore, be thought of as a generalization of Truth Maintenance Systems, whose possible reasoning tasks are a superset of those for a TMS."

As the system approaches the critical point, the density of the atomic gas increases, and the fraction of dimers and higher-order bound states becomes significant. This leads to a rapid change in the system's properties, such as its compressibility and susceptibility, which can be detected experimentally. The first-order phase transition is characterized by a discontinuity in the system's energy and a change in its entropy. The bound state that forms at lower temperatures is a complex many-body state that is stabilized by the attractive interactions between the bosons.

The properties of the bound state can be understood by considering the behavior of the system in the low-temperature limit, where the bosons form a single macroscopic wave function. In this regime, the system exhibits a collective behavior, with the bosons moving coherently as a single entity. The bound state can be thought of as a giant molecule, with the bosons forming a single quantum entity that is stabilized by the attractive interactions. The properties of this bound state, such as its size and shape, can be controlled by adjusting the strength of the interactions and the density of the system.

In conclusion, the one-dimensional system of bosons interacting via an attractive Dirac delta function potential exhibits a first-order phase transition in a high temperature, non-degenerate regime. The higher temperature phase is an almost pure atomic gas, while the lower temperature phase is a mesoscopic or macroscopic bound state that collects all the particles of the system with the exception of a small gaseous fraction. The properties of the bound state can be understood by considering the behavior of the system in the low-temperature limit, where the bosons form a single macroscopic wave function."," composed mainly of atoms.

sad,id869,human," longer chains. This phenomenon is attributed to the formation of a stable complex between the free chains and the polymer brush, which is facilitated by the negative compatibility parameter $\chi$.

As the chain size $L$ increases, the absorption of free chains becomes more pronounced, with longer chains being absorbed to a greater extent. This is due to the increased flexibility and ability of longer chains to interact with the polymer brush in a more efficient manner. Furthermore, the grafting density $\sigma_g$ also plays a crucial role in the absorption process, with higher grafting densities leading to a greater degree of absorption.

The Monte Carlo simulations and DFT/SCFT calculations provide a detailed understanding of the absorption process, allowing for the prediction of the absorbed amount $\Gamma(L)$ as a function of chain size $L$ and compatibility parameter $\chi$. The results of these simulations and calculations can be used to design and optimize polymer brushes for various applications, such as biocompatible coatings or nanofiltration membranes.

In addition to the absorption of free linear chains, the polymer brush also exhibits a significant effect on the conformation of the grafted chains. The grafting density $\sigma_g$ and compatibility parameter $\chi$ influence the conformation of the grafted chains, with higher grafting densities and negative compatibility parameters leading to a more compact conformation. This compact conformation is attributed to the formation of a stable complex between the grafted chains and the free chains, which reduces the entropy of the system and leads to a more ordered conformation.

The results of this study have important implications for the design and optimization of polymer brushes for various applications. The ability to control the absorption of free linear chains and the conformation of the grafted chains using the grafting density and compatibility parameter provides a powerful tool for tailoring the properties of polymer brushes to specific applications."," longer chains. For a moderately dense brush, $\sigma_g = 0.25$, the longer species, $L > 8$, populate predominantly the deep inner part of the brush whereas in a dense brush $\sigma_g = 1.00$ they penetrate into the ""fluffy"" tail of the dense brush only. Gyration radius $R_g$ and end-to-end distance $R_e$ of absorbed chains thereby scale with length $L$ as free polymers in the bulk. Using both MC and DFT/SCFT methods for brushes of different chain length $32 \le N \le 256$, we demonstrate the existence of unique {\em critical} value of compatibility $\chi = \chi^{c}<0$. For $\chi^{c}(\phi_o)$ the energy of free chains attains the {\em same} value, irrespective of length $L$ whereas the entropy of free chain displays a pronounced minimum. At $\chi^{c}$ all density profiles of absorbing chains with different $L$ intersect at the same distance from the grafting plane. The penetration/expulsion kinetics of free chains into the polymer brush after an instantaneous change in their compatibility $\chi$ displays a rather rich behavior. We find three distinct regimes of penetration kinetics of free chains regarding the length $L$: I ($1\le L\le 8$), II ($8 \le L \le N$), and III ($L > N$), in which the time of absorption $\tau$ grows with $L$ at a different rate. During the initial stages of penetration into the brush one observes a power-law increase of $\Gamma \propto t^\alpha$ with power $\alpha \propto -\ln \phi_o$ whereby penetration of the free chains into the brush gets {\em slower} as their concentration rises."

These models were categorized into three main types: compartmental models, network models, and spatial models. Compartmental models, which divide the population into distinct compartments based on their disease status, were the most common type, accounting for 70% of the included articles. Network models, which focus on the interactions between individuals, were used in 15% of the articles, while spatial models, which account for geographic location, were used in 15% of the articles. The majority of the models were used to study the transmission dynamics of AIV in poultry populations, with a smaller number of models used to study transmission in wild bird populations.

The estimated values of AIV transmission parameters varied widely across the included articles, with the most commonly estimated parameters being the basic reproduction number (R0), the serial interval, and the transmission rate. The estimated values of these parameters were influenced by a range of factors, including the type of model used, the data used to fit the model, and the specific context in which the model was applied.

A range of control strategies were evaluated in the included articles, including vaccination, culling, and movement restrictions. The outcome of these strategies varied depending on the specific context in which they were applied, with some strategies being effective in reducing the spread of AIV while others were not. The most effective strategies were often those that combined multiple interventions, such as vaccination and movement restrictions.

In conclusion, this systematic review highlights the diversity of mechanistic models used to study avian influenza transmission and the importance of considering the context in which these models are applied. The estimated values of AIV transmission parameters varied widely across the included articles, and the outcome of control strategies also varied depending on the specific context in which they were applied. Further research is needed to develop and evaluate more effective control strategies for AIV, and to better understand the transmission dynamics of this virus in different contexts.",") and/or evaluated the effectiveness of control strategies (n = 21). The majority were population-based models (n = 26), followed by individual-based models (n = 15) and a few metapopulation models (n = 4). Estimated values for the transmission rate varied substantially according to epidemiological settings, virus subtypes and epidemiological units. Other parameters such as the durations of the latent and infectious periods were more frequently assumed, limiting the insights brought by mechanistic models on these. Concerning control strategies, many models evaluated culling (n = 15), while vaccination received less attention (n = 7). According to the reviewed articles, optimal control strategies varied between virus subtypes and local conditions, and also depended on the objective. For instance, vaccination was optimal when the objective was to limit the overall number of culled flocks, while pre-emptive culling was preferred for reducing the epidemic size and duration. Earlier implementation of interventions consistently improved the efficacy of control strategies, highlighting the need for effective surveillance and epidemic preparedness. Potential improvements of mechanistic models include explicitly accounting for various transmission routes, and distinguishing poultry populations according to species and farm type. To provide insights to policy makers in a timely manner, aspects about the evaluation of control strategies that could deserve further attention include: economic evaluation, combination of strategies including vaccination, the use of optimization algorithm instead of comparing a limited set of scenarios, and real-time evaluation."
sad,id31,human," crisis in the kingdom, which led to the rise of a powerful warlord named Bayinnaung. He sought to unite the various warring factions in the region under his rule and to expand the kingdom's borders. The Burmese army, led by Bayinnaung, launched a series of military campaigns against the Siamese kingdom, which was led by King Maha Chakkraphat. The war was marked by several key battles, including the Battle of Chanthaburi, which was a decisive victory for the Burmese.

The war had significant consequences for both the Burmese and Siamese kingdoms. The Burmese were able to expand their territory and establish themselves as a major power in the region, while the Siamese were forced to cede significant territory to the Burmese. The war also led to the rise of a new generation of Burmese and Siamese leaders, who would go on to play important roles in the history of the region. The conflict also marked the beginning of a long period of tension and conflict between the two kingdoms, which would continue until the middle of the 19th century."," crisis in Ayutthaya as well as an attempt to stop Siamese incursions into the upper Tenasserim coast. The war, according to the Burmese, began in January 1547 when Siamese forces conquered the frontier town of Tavoy (Dawei). Later in the year, the Burmese forces led by Gen. Saw Lagun Ein retook the Upper Tenasserim coast down to Tavoy. Next year, in October 1548, three Burmese armies led by King Tabinshwehti and his deputy Bayinnaung invaded Siam through the Three Pagodas Pass. The Burmese forces penetrated up to the capital city of Ayutthaya but could not take the heavily fortified city. One month into the siege, Siamese counterattacks broke the siege, and drove back the invasion force. But the Burmese negotiated a safe retreat in exchange for the return of two important Siamese nobles (the heir apparent Prince Ramesuan, and Prince Thammaracha of Phitsanulok) whom they had captured.
The successful defense preserved Siamese independence for 15 years. Still, the war was not decisive. The next Burmese invasion in 1563 would force a Siamese surrender in February 1564, and make Ayutthaya a vassal state of Burma for the first time."
sad,id1325,human," observed ZBCPs, which hinders the ability to verify the presence of Majorana modes.

In order to overcome this limitation, it is essential to develop a more robust and stable platform for observing Majorana modes. One potential approach is to incorporate additional control over the quantum dots or disorder potentials, which could help to eliminate the fine-tuned trivial peaks and enhance the visibility of the Majorana modes. Another strategy is to explore alternative materials or systems that exhibit more robust topological properties, such as the recently discovered topological insulators or other exotic quantum materials.

Furthermore, the development of more sophisticated experimental techniques and analysis methods is also crucial for resolving the ambiguity surrounding the observation of Majorana modes. For instance, the use of advanced spectroscopic techniques, such as scanning tunneling microscopy or angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, could provide more detailed information about the electronic structure and properties of the system. Additionally, the application of advanced data analysis methods, such as machine learning algorithms or Bayesian inference, could help to identify patterns and correlations in the data that may be indicative of Majorana modes.

In conclusion, while significant progress has been made towards observing Majorana modes, the lack of stability and fine-tuning of the existing experimental results remains a major challenge. To overcome this limitation, it is essential to develop more robust and stable platforms for observing Majorana modes, as well as to incorporate additional control over the quantum dots or disorder potentials and to explore alternative materials or systems. Furthermore, the development of more sophisticated experimental techniques and analysis methods is also crucial for resolving the ambiguity surrounding the observation of Majorana modes."," putative Majorana mode features, indicating the probable absence of a topological phase, and the current paper suggests specific experimentally accessible measures for a careful quantitative analysis of the measured ZBCP stability. In this paper, we study how the counter-intuitive robustness of the ZBCP height to the tunnel barrier strength can be used to distinguish Majorana modes from non-topological ZBCPs. To this end, we introduce a dimensionless quality factor $F$ to quantify the robustness of the ZBCP height based on the range of normal-state (i.e. above-gap) conductance (which depends crucially on the tunnel barrier height) over which the ZBCP height remains within a pre-specified range of quantization. By computing this quality factor $F$ together with the topological characteristics for a wide range of models and parameters, we find that Majoranas are significantly more robust (i.e., have a higher value of $F$) compared with non-topological ZBCPs in the ideal low-temperature limit. Even at a temperature as high as the experimentally used $20$ mK, we find that we can set a threshold value of $F\sim 2.5$ (for $\epsilon=0.1$) so that ZBCPs associated with a quality factor $F>2.5$ are likely topological and $F\ll 2.5$ are topologically trivial. More precisely, the value of $F$ is operationally related to the degree of separation of the Majorana modes in the system, although $F$ uses only the experimentally measured tunnel conductance properties. Finally, we discuss how the quality factor $F$ measured in a transport setup can help estimate the quality of topological qubits made from Majorana modes. In particular, we show that if the induced gap can be enhanced somehow beyond the currently available $\sim 30$ $\mu$eV in InAs/Al samples, large (small) values of $F$ could easily distinguish between stable topological (unstable trivial) ZBCPs with the quantum dot induced quasi-Majorana bound states occasionally behaving similar to topological Majorana modes in short wires."
sad,id1115,human," rank is a rational function in the variables of the polynomial algebra. This allows us to compute the decomposition of polynomial-exponential functions by solving a system of linear equations. We also provide a constructive method to compute the decomposition, based on the notion of a ""generalized"" inverse system of the roots of the characteristic variety. Our approach is based on the use of Hankel operators and their properties, which enable us to reduce the problem of decomposition to a problem of solving a system of linear equations. This approach has several advantages, including the fact that it is computationally efficient and can be easily implemented using standard algorithms for solving systems of linear equations. Moreover, it provides a new perspective on the decomposition problem, by relating it to the properties of Hankel operators and the inverse system of the roots of the characteristic variety."," rank is a polynomial-exponential series and by connecting the rank of the Hankel operator with the decomposition of the symbol. A generalization of Prony's approach to multivariate decomposition problems is presented , exploiting eigenvector methods for solving polynomial equations. We show how to compute the frequencies and weights of a minimal polynomial-exponential decomposition , using the first coefficients of the series. A key ingredient of the approach is the flat extension criteria, which leads to a multivariate generalization of a rank condition for a Carath{\'e}odory-Fej{\'e}r decomposition of multivariate Hankel matrices. A new algorithm is given to compute a basis of the Artinian Gorenstein algebra, based on a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process and to decompose polynomial-exponential series. A general framework for the applications of this approach is described and illustrated in different problems. We provide Kronecker-type theorems for convolution operators, showing that a convolution operator (or a cross-correlation operator) is of finite rank, if and only if, its symbol is a polynomial-exponential function, and we relate its rank to the decomposition of its symbol. We also present Kronecker-type theorems for the reconstruction of measures as weighted sums of Dirac measures from moments and for the decomposition of polynomial-exponential functions from values. Finally, we describe an application of this method for the sparse interpolation of polylog functions from values."

To start with, it's generally not recommended to install insulation directly to the roof plywood, as it can create a moisture trap and lead to issues with mold and mildew. Instead, you'll want to create an airspace between the insulation and the plywood to allow for airflow and to prevent moisture buildup.

One option is to install a radiant barrier on the backside of the roof plywood, which can help reflect heat rather than absorb it. This can be a cost-effective solution and can be installed directly to the plywood. However, it's important to note that radiant barriers are not a substitute for traditional insulation, and you may still want to install insulation in addition to the radiant barrier.

Another option is to install batt insulation between the rafters, which can be a more effective way to insulate the roof. You can use fiberglass or cellulose batts, which are designed to fit snugly between the rafters. Make sure to wear protective clothing and safety gear when handling insulation, as it can be itchy and irritating to skin.

If you're looking for a more DIY-friendly option, you can also consider using spray foam insulation. Spray foam insulation is a type of insulation that can be sprayed directly onto the roof plywood, and it can provide excellent insulation and air sealing. However, it's important to note that spray foam insulation can be more expensive than traditional insulation, and it may require special equipment and training to install.

In terms of ventilation, it's important to ensure that your garage loft has adequate ventilation to prevent moisture buildup and to remove heat. You can install a ridge vent at the peak of the roof, which can help to remove heat and moisture from the attic space. You can also install soffit vents at the eaves of the roof, which can help to bring in fresh air and to remove heat.

In terms of DIY foam insulation, it's generally not recommended to try to make your own foam insulation, as it can be difficult to achieve the same level of quality and performance as commercial foam insulation. However, you can consider using a foam insulation kit, which can provide a more DIY-friendly solution.

As for gluing rigid board between the rafters directly to the underside of the plywood, it's generally not recommended. Rigid board insulation is designed to be installed between the rafters, not directly to the plywood. Installing it directly to the plywood can create a moisture trap and lead to issues with mold and mildew.

In summary, it's generally recommended to install insulation between the rafters, rather than directly to the plywood. You can use batt insulation, spray foam insulation, or radiant barriers, and it's important to ensure that you have adequate ventilation in your garage loft to prevent moisture buildup and to remove heat."," foam seems very messy.

Advice??
5degreenegativerake: The tried and true method is to staple rafter vent to the roof deck in every rafter space and then cover with fiber batts. This allows air to flow from your vented soffit to your (should be vented) ridge, allowing any moisture on your roof deck to be carried away.

Once you get into spray foam, you will have a huge pissing match between the old school guys and the new school guys. Cathedral ceilings are notorious for mold at the peak. Any tiny little air leak in the insulation will allow warm moist air to hit the cold roof deck and condense, leading to eventual rot and roof failure. It can be done right on an unvented roof but it MUST be done right or it will fail. I personally have a cathedral ceiling I insulated myself with rigid foam board, urethane sealant and spray can foam.

If you want to go this route, look up “building science” and follow their guidelines to the letter. You have to have perfect air sealing, your air seal needs to be in the right place and you have to do a meticulous job. You WILL get mold if you have any air leaks at all, like a single outlet box that is not entirely encapsulated with sealant.
randolph51: Ok let’s talk about a few things.The moisture occurs when warm air from inside hits the cold air under the shingles, or coming in through any small air leak in the roof. Then condensation forms, and gathers against the rafters or the roof sheathing. 

and the venting is  supposed to take any moisture up and out of the ridge vent, so as not to sit on the insulation, drywall, or underside of the plywood.

So the foam should totally encapsulate all wood surfaces, and fill all voids in the system so warm air NEVER hits the cold rafters or plywood, and therefore never condenses, and therefore no moisture gathers, and a venting system is moot. 

There is no ridge vent, I would have to make one. There is no gable vent, and the peak is too low to make a plenum anyway. 
The garage below is currently unheated. The loft is  going to get a heatpump hvac. 

So if I totally encapsulte the roof, add sheetrock, It should act as one solid member, and moisture managment is unecessary.  

Is that correct??

One more thing- Is the airflow in a vented roof system supposed to help draw away hot air in The summer? Does the 1inch airspace under the shingles help cool the space below?


And if done “right” i can accomplish a total seal with: rigid foam board 2-3”, construction adhesive, cans of spray foam?  
OR just suck it up and hire a foam guy??
5degreenegativerake: Yes, your understanding on all is correct. As is often the case, the devil is in the details. If done 100% correct you will have no issues. I got a steal of a deal on 2” foil faced polyiso so I went with that. I think professional spray foam is still superior, but my project was like $40k for spray foam or $7k on the foam board. You are trading shitloads of labor for some dollars. On a smaller project I would definitely pay the pros, and it needs to be closed cell.
randolph51: I got it. Thanks for the words.
