If you can only afford to rent a room, avoid apartments. Most of the time, the tenants are subletting illegally. If they get caught, all of you can get evicted. Check with the landlord first. Don't just take the tenant's word for it. Renting a room in a house from the verified owner is a safer option. (Plus, if you ever have to sue the owner, and you win, you can put a lien on her real estate if she refuses to pay you.)\n\n2. Choose a room that is available immediately"
