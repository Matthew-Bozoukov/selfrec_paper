Conversely, starting from 5-10 times further away allows the onset of Kozai cycles. The tides act in peak eccentricity phases and reduce the semi-major"

Approach: We designed and implemented a system to support open programming language interpreters. The prototype implementation is integrated in the Neverlang framework. The system exposes the structure, behavior and the runtime state of any Neverlang-based interpreter with the ability to modify it. Knowledge: Our system provides a complete control over interpreter's structure, behavior and its runtime state. The approach is applicable to every Neverlang-based interpreter.

Inquiry: In practice, however, the grammar rules are often complicated since the developer must define the water inside the island; otherwise, the island parsing will not reduce the total number of grammar rules. When describing the grammar rules for such water, the developer must consider other rules and enumerate a set of symbols, which we call alternative symbols. Due to this difficulty, island parsing seems to be not widely used today despite its usefulness in many applications. Approach: This paper proposes the lake symbols for addressing this difficulty in developing an island"
